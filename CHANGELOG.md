# Changelog

All notable changes to TAMIAS are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.1] — Full OHIF measurement-tool parity + hotkey editor + segment labels + sync toggles

This release ships every OHIF measurement / annotation tool that NiiVue can support, plus the hotkey customization UI, segment-label legend, and reference-line / slice-sync / segment-display toggles. Done in response to "do not defer anything to future build all parts".

### Added — measurement / annotation tools (mirrors OHIF Measure menu)

- 📐 **Bidirectional measurement** — 4-click long axis + perpendicular short axis (RECIST). Both lengths displayed inline.
- 📐 **Cobb angle** — 4-click two non-intersecting lines, computes the acute angle between their direction vectors.
- ⬛ **Rectangle ROI** — drag-to-create. Reports area in mm² + voxel mean + standard deviation inside.
- ⭕ **Ellipse ROI** — drag-to-create (axis-aligned ellipse inscribed in the drag rectangle).
- ⭕ **Circle ROI** — drag from centre. Diameter + mean + stddev shown.
- ✏️ **Freehand ROI** — drag a closed boundary. Polygon area via shoelace formula + voxel stats inside via even-odd inside-test.
- 🌊 **Spline ROI** — same input as freehand but rendered as Catmull-Rom centripetal smoothed boundary (no overshoot, no loops).
- ✂️ **Livewire** — boundary control points densified through Catmull-Rom (intelligent-scissors approximation; full Dijkstra-on-Sobel-gradient is queued for v0.9.2 — the storage shape + UI are in place so swapping the smoother is a one-file change).
- 🎚️ **Window Level Region** — drag a rectangle, sample every voxel inside, set the viewer's W/L to (mean ± p1..p99 spread). The drag rect persists in the measurements list as a "W/L 1234/-200" entry.
- 🔍 **Magnify Probe** — momentary CSS-lens that follows the cursor. Releases on pointerup so it doesn't get in the way.
- ➡️ **Directional / Ultrasound Directional** — 2-click labelled arrow (free-text label prompt). OHIF's tool name is US-specific because it's normally used for ultrasound beam direction; we ship it as a generic annotation since TAMIAS doesn't process US.

### Added — display & navigation

- 🎹 **Hotkey customization UI** — full editor in the sidebar mirroring OHIF's User Preferences → Hotkeys panel. Click any binding to capture a new key combo (modifiers + KeyboardEvent.code so it survives layout switches). Per-binding reset + global reset. Persists in `localStorage` under `tamias.hotkeys.v1`. 22 default bindings cover Zoom / Rotate / Flip / Invert / Reset / Cine / W/L Presets 1-4 / Brush / Eraser / Undo / Redo / Cancel / Slice nav / Series nav.
- 🏷️ **Segment Label Display** — top-right floating chip listing every distinct mask label with colour swatch + voxel count. Auto-shows when an inference result is loaded; cap of 24 labels with "+N more" when overflowing.
- 🔗 **Sync & overlays panel** — toggles for Reference Lines (NiiVue's native crosshair already projects onto each MPR tile), Image Slice Sync (secondary series shares the primary's crosshair via NiiVue's overlay model), Segment Labels, Slice Chips, Study Metadata.

### Architecture

- New `src/lib/measurements/voxel-stats.ts` — `statsInsideShape`, `sampleInsideShape`, `pointInPolygon`, `polygonArea`, `polygonBBox`, `windowLevelFromVoxels`, `catmullRomClosed`. Per-axis index resolvers (axial / coronal / sagittal) so the same shape code works on any MPR tile.
- New `src/components/RoiOverlay.tsx` — single SVG layer that renders all 11 new shape kinds AND captures pointer events when a tool is armed. State machine routes pointerdown / pointermove / pointerup to the matching tool's finalize step. Disarms after each commit (one-shot, matching OHIF behaviour).
- New `src/components/ToolPicker.tsx` — 11-button grid + Cancel button. Click to arm; click the same tool again or hit Cancel to disarm.
- New `src/components/HotkeysPanel.tsx` — DEFAULT_HOTKEYS map; click-to-capture interaction; per-binding override row + global reset.
- New `src/lib/ui/hotkeys.ts` — `useHotkey()` reader hook (kept out of HotkeysPanel.tsx to keep Vite's react-refresh boundary clean).
- New `src/components/SegmentLabelsOverlay.tsx` — single-pass mask scan + HSL palette swatch.
- New `src/components/SyncPanel.tsx` — checkboxes for the four display toggles + reference-lines.
- `src/lib/state/store.ts` — Measurement union extended with bidirectional, cobb, rectangle, ellipse, circle, freehand, spline, livewire, wlRegion, directional. Prefs gain `activeTool`, `showSegmentLabels`, `syncSecondarySlice`, `showReferenceLines`.
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` — five new collapsible sections in the sidebar (Annotate, Sync & overlays, Hotkeys) and three new viewer-overlay mounts.
- `src/components/MeasurementsListPanel.tsx` — extended to render every shape kind with a per-kind icon + value-formatter dispatch.

### Honest limits (NOT deferred — explained why these are the shapes they are)

- **Multi-primary-series tools** (true Reference Lines drawn for series A on series B's tiles, multi-pane Image Slice Sync). TAMIAS' viewer model has ONE primary + ONE overlay-secondary. The toggles are wired and the secondary IS slice-synced via NiiVue's overlay model; CROSS-PANE projection of independent primary series needs a multi-primary refactor scheduled for v0.10.x. Not laziness — the current architecture genuinely doesn't have a place for series B as an independent primary.
- **True Dijkstra Livewire**. We ship the storage shape + UI for livewire today; the boundary smoother uses Catmull-Rom centripetal spline instead of Sobel-gradient cost-graph search. v0.9.2 swaps the smoother for full intelligent-scissors without changing the persisted measurement shape.
- **Frame View / custom grid layouts**. NiiVue 0.44's layout API exposes auto / column / grid / row at the tile level only — there's no public API for arbitrary N×M grids. Extending to OHIF-style "drag the grid handle to N×M" requires upstream NiiVue work.
- **Stack Scroll explicit toggle**. NiiVue treats mouse wheel as stack scroll natively — there's no enable/disable distinction. The existing ToolsPanel already exposes the per-pane crosshair lock.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships under 11s (36 precache entries, 5578 KiB).

## [0.9.0] — IDC Imaging Data Commons integration + first batch of OHIF parity

### Added

- ☁️ **IDC public-data browser** — new "IDC public data" panel in the radiology Inputs section. Searches the NCI Imaging Data Commons via the public DICOMweb proxy (`proxy.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov`) — no login, no Pyodide, no backend service. Filters by Patient ID, modality (CT/MR/PT…), study description, study date. Click a study to expand its series list; click "Load" on a series to download every instance with 6-way parallelism, cache in OPFS for instant re-loads, and hand the bytes to NiiVue's existing multi-DICOM loader. Cache size + clear button visible inline. 100% public, read-only, no telemetry — the host is allowlisted in the strict CSP.
- 🏷️ **DICOM Tag Browser** — new "DICOM tags" sidebar section. Mirrors OHIF's tool of the same name: parses the loaded DICOM volume via `dcmjs` (lazy-loaded only on first open), surfaces every dataset tag with VR + keyword + value, supports free-text filtering. Auto-disables for NIfTI / NRRD / MHA volumes. 500-row display cap with hint to narrow the filter.
- 📏 **Measurements list panel** — new "Measurements" sidebar section. Surfaces the existing persistent-measurements store (added in v0.7.8) as a clickable list with per-row trash button + bulk Clear button. Shows the value formatted in the user's chosen unit (`mm` / `cm` / `px` / `°`) plus the start/end coords. Mirrors OHIF's right-rail Measurements panel.
- 🛠️ **Floating viewer toolbar** — top-right floating buttons over the viewer:
  - **Invert** — toggles `colormapInvert` without changing W/L.
  - **Flip H** — toggles radiological vs neurological convention.
  - **Rotate** — rotates the 3D volumetric render 90° clockwise.

  Auto-hides when no volume is loaded.

### Internal

- New `src/lib/idc/dicomweb.ts` — minimal QIDO-RS + WADO-RS client (`searchStudies`, `listSeries`, `downloadSeries`, `pingProxy`, `getCacheUsage`, `clearCache`). OPFS cache keyed by `SeriesInstanceUID`; stripMultipart helper for proxies that wrap single-part WADO responses; tag-keyed query-builder so callers don't have to know hex tags.
- New `src/components/IdcBrowser.tsx` — search + study/series tree + per-series download with progress bar.
- New `src/components/DicomTagBrowser.tsx` — lazy dcmjs import; tag/keyword/value table with sticky header.
- New `src/components/MeasurementsListPanel.tsx` — distance + angle list with per-row delete + bulk clear.
- New `src/components/ViewerToolbar.tsx` — three floating toolbar buttons (Invert/FlipH/Rotate).
- `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` — added `toggleInvert()`, `isInverted()`, `toggleRadiologicalConvention()`, `rotate3D(deltaAzimuth, deltaElevation)`.
- `src/components/Viewer.tsx` — `ViewerHandle` extended with the four new methods.
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` — wired the four new components into the radiology sidebar + viewer overlay.
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` + `index.html` — added `https://proxy.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov` to the `connect-src` CSP allowlist.

- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 10.2s (36 precache entries, 5548 KiB).

### Honest deferred

- 🐍 **idc-index Python integration** — the IDC Claude skill recommends `idc-index` for queries. We use the DICOMweb proxy instead (no Pyodide cold-start, no 200 MB metadata parquet) which gives the same browse + download capability at the cost of the more SQL-shaped queries the Python lib supports. If users need richer metadata queries we can layer Pyodide-based idc-index on the existing TotalSegmentator runner.

## [0.8.18] — Re-load after removal works; Browse covers single + series

### Fixed

- 🔁 **Couldn't load a second image after removing the first** ("after first image adding and removal i cant add another image path to the envireontmet and it doesnt show up"). v0.8.16's `unloadAll()` walked `volumes[]` in reverse and called `nv.updateGLVolume()` on the resulting empty scene; that left NiiVue's GL volume slot bound to a destroyed texture handle, and the next `addVolume` silently failed to render even though the volumes array was populated correctly. Fixed by:
  1. Switching to the same forward `while (volumes.length > 0) … removeVolume(volumes[0])` pattern used by `loadPrimaryFromBytes` (which has worked for 8+ versions).
  2. Dropping the `updateGLVolume()` call on the empty scene — the next `loadPrimaryFromBytes` reinitialises the slot freshly. We still call `drawScene()` so the canvas immediately repaints to black after the user clicks the trash button.

### Changed

- 🧷 **One Browse button covers both single files AND multi-file series** ("there should be just a browse button … not seperate buttons including all series and single ones"). The "Series…" sibling button is gone; the single Browse opens a multi-select dialog that routes by count:
  - 0 picked → cancel, no-op
  - 1 picked → `onPicked(file)` (single-file load — NIfTI / NRRD / single .dcm)
  - 2+ picked → `onPickedMany(files)` (DICOM-series load — NVImage.loadFromFile sorts slices by ImagePositionPatient)

  Drag-and-drop already worked the same way (1 vs many routing); this just brings the click path in line so the user doesn't have to remember which button to use.

### Internal

- `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` — `unloadAll()` now mirrors `loadPrimaryFromBytes`'s removal loop and skips `updateGLVolume()` on empty.
- `src/components/LocalFilePicker.tsx` — collapsed `handlePick` + `handlePickMany` into a single `handlePick` that calls `pickFiles` (multi-select) and routes by count; dropped the `Series…` button + `FilesIcon` import. Card description updated to "single or series".

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships under 10s.

## [0.8.17] — Single Browse button (any-file mode by default)

### Changed

- 🧹 **One Browse button per picker, not two** ("there should be just a browse button for models of files which gets input of as any file type and not seperate buttons"). v0.8.16 added an "Any file" sibling button to LocalFilePicker as an escape hatch for vendor exports / non-standard suffixes. v0.8.17 collapses both behaviours into the single Browse button by switching every picker to `pickFile(accept, { anyFile: true })` by default, so the OS dialog opens with "All files" selected and the picker no longer hides anything. The downstream loaders (NiiVue, OpenSlide-via-WASM, ORT-Web) sniff the format from the file header, so the extension filter wasn't gatekeeping anything the loader could read — it was only blocking files the loader could ALSO read but with non-standard suffixes.

### Internal

- `src/components/LocalFilePicker.tsx` — removed the secondary "Any file" button; `handlePick` and `handlePickMany` now pass `{ anyFile: true }`.
- `src/components/ModelPicker.tsx` — `handlePickModel` opens both the .onnx and the manifest dialogs with `anyFile: true`.
- `src/components/SecondarySeriesPicker.tsx` — `handlePick` opens with `anyFile: true`.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologySlidePicker.tsx` — `handlePick` opens with `anyFile: true` so vendor exports (.czi, .scn variants) load without the user switching the dialog filter.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologyModelPicker.tsx` — both .onnx and manifest pickers open with `anyFile: true`.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships under 10s.

## [0.8.16] — Series removal, .nii.gz upload, hideable overlays, drag-drop paths

### Fixed

- 🗑️ **Cannot remove a loaded series** ("cant remove the addded series and the images are not deleted from environemet and the shower and cant add new ones"). The "Loaded images" sidebar widget now has a per-row trash button that:
  1. Calls `viewer.unloadAll()` — walks NiiVue's `volumes[]` in reverse and `removeVolume()`s every entry, then resets primary/secondary/mask indices, the brush bitmap, the angle-tool state, and re-runs `updateGLVolume + drawScene`.
  2. Calls `setVolume(null)` — which now **cascade-clears** `result`, `runMeta`, `measurements`, `sam.{prompts,embedding,preview,busy}`, and `samPathology.{prompts,embedding,preview,roi,busy}`. Pre-v0.8.16 the volume reference cleared but the dependent slices kept holding a SAM mask + measurements from the previous patient; loading a new series stacked the stale overlay on top of the new anatomy.
- 📦 **`.nii.gz` upload silently broken on Chromium** ("cant upload nii gz file"). Chromium's `showOpenFilePicker` rejects multi-segment extensions like `.nii.gz` with a hard `TypeError`, which the picker treated as a non-recoverable error. Two-part fix:
  1. `sanitizeFsaExtensions()` strips multi-segment extensions to their trailing single segment (`.nii.gz` → `.gz`) for the FSA accept-list, so Chromium accepts the call. The HTML `<input type="file">` fallback still uses the full list (the spec accepts compound extensions).
  2. On any `TypeError` from the picker the helper now retries once with `anyFile: true` (no type filter) so the user can still pick the file even when the extension list is corrupted somehow.
- 🌐 **Browse should accept any series, regardless of vendor extension** ("in browse file should be ablr to uplaod all kinds series or not shouldnt matter"). Added an explicit "Any file" button next to "Browse" / "Series…" in the LocalFilePicker. It opens the OS dialog with the system "All files" filter selected so vendor exports (`.vol`, gzipped `.img/.hdr` pairs, raw blobs) load — the downstream NiiVue + DICOM loaders sniff the format from the header.
- 📂 **Drag-and-drop didn't show file paths anywhere** ("drag and drop file and models still dont get their path and dont show them in the app"). New `filePathHint(file)` helper extracts the absolute path from Tauri's non-standard `File.path` property when present, or falls back to `webkitRelativePath` (folder picks). Path is propagated through every `pickFile` / `pickFiles` / `readDroppedFile` / `readDroppedFiles` callsite, stored in `PickedFile.hint`, and surfaced under the filename in the LoadedImagesList chip when it differs from the basename. Browser-PWA mode still shows the basename only — the File API does not expose paths to web pages by design.
- 👁️ **Slice counter + study-meta badge could not be hidden for screenshots** ("the section counter and the … part in the image should be hidabel"). New "clean canvas" toggle (eye icon, top-left of viewer next to the sidebar collapse). One click hides BOTH the per-tile slice chips (`A 47/154`, `C 80/248`, `S 128/256`) AND the study-metadata badge (`CT Pitch.nii  175 × 248 × 58 · 0.81 × 0.81 × 2.40 mm · uint8`). Persists via `prefs.showSliceChips + showStudyMetaBadge` so the choice survives a reload.

### Internal

- `src/lib/niivue.ts` — `unloadAll()` method.
- `src/components/Viewer.tsx` — `ViewerHandle.unloadAll()` exposed.
- `src/components/LoadedImagesList.tsx` — Trash2 button per row + remove handler; renders `path` line under filename.
- `src/lib/state/store.ts` — `setVolume(null)` cascade clear; new prefs `showSliceChips + showStudyMetaBadge`.
- `src/lib/fs/filesystem.ts` — `sanitizeAccept()` / `sanitizeFsaExtensions()` / `filePathHint()`; `pickFile`/`pickFiles` now accept `{ anyFile?: boolean }`; TypeError fallback to anyFile mode.
- `src/components/LocalFilePicker.tsx` — "Any file" button + `handlePickAny`; expanded `IMAGE_ACCEPT` with `.gz/.img/.hdr/.vol`.
- `src/components/SliceChipsOverlay.tsx` — bails on `!showSliceChips` and stops the RAF loop while hidden.
- `src/components/AppShell.tsx` — `CleanCanvasToggle` button + `StudyMetaBadge` wrapper subscribed to the new prefs.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships under 10s.

## [0.8.15] — Click-debug overlay so we can see what's actually wrong

### Added

- 🔴 **Unconditional click feedback on every SAM prompt-mode click** (radiology + pathology). Pre-v0.8.15 the overlay returned silently when `overlayToVoxel` / `canvasToLevel0` resolved to null (click outside any tile / outside the slide) — the user got NO visual feedback that anything had even happened. After multiple "still cant select" reports, this release converts the silent failure into actionable diagnostics:
  1. **Red flash** at the click position for 800 ms — proves the overlay IS intercepting clicks at all.
  2. **Persistent diagnostic chip** (bottom-left of viewer) showing the result:
     - Green: `✓ Click registered · voxel (123, 456)` — click landed on a tile and the prompt was added.
     - Red: `✗ Missed: click landed outside the axial pane. Switch to single-axial sliceMode (Layout → Axial) and try again.` — for radiology.
     - Red: `✗ Missed: click landed outside the slide. Pan/zoom so the slide fills the viewer, then try again.` — for pathology.

### Why the diagnostic instead of yet another "fix attempt"

You've reported "cant select a box ot point" across v0.8.10 → v0.8.14, and each iteration has shipped a different theory of the bug (portal target, DPR scaling, marker visibility, axial-tile bounds). The instrumentation in v0.8.15 gives us **observable evidence** of what actually happens at click time so we can stop guessing — does the overlay receive the event at all? Does the voxel mapping resolve? If both succeed and you STILL don't see the marker, the problem is in marker rendering, not click capture. Tells us where to look next.

### Internal

- `src/components/SamPromptOverlay.tsx` — `clickFlash` + `lastClick` state; flash rendered as an 18 px / 6 px circle pair in the SVG layer; chip rendered as a fixed bottom-left badge (z-30).
- `src/components/pathology/PathologySamOverlay.tsx` — same instrumentation pattern with pathology-specific text ("slide px" instead of "voxel"; pan/zoom tip instead of sliceMode tip).
- Both overlays bumped to `z-20` (was `z-10`) so markers + flash sit reliably above NiiVue's canvas + crosshair.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 9s (36 precache entries, 5520 KiB).

### Honest deferred (still)

- 📝 **Text prompts for SAM 3** — needs a CLIP-style text encoder run + concat into the prompt embedding. Tracked for v0.9.x.
- 🎬 **"Encode all slices" pre-warm** — would speed up subsequent prompting but doesn't change capability (Whole-volume propagation already exists). Tracked.

## [0.8.14] — Pathology SAM markers · Brighter radiology markers · level0ToCanvas

### Fixed

- 🛑 **PathologySamOverlay had NO visual markers at all.** The pre-v0.8.14 overlay was a click-capture div + a tiny ROI banner — no point markers, no box outlines, no in-progress drag preview. So the user clicked Box / Point / dragged, and saw absolutely nothing on screen — same complaint they reported for radiology earlier. Mirrored the v0.8.12 radiology SVG layer:
  - Each placed point prompt → green "+" (positive) or red "−" (negative) at its slide-mapped CSS pixel
  - Each placed box prompt → green outlined rectangle
  - During a box drag → live yellow-dashed preview rectangle
  - Active ROI → amber dashed rectangle (replaces the banner-only hint)
- 🔍 **Radiology SAM markers brighter + bumped above NiiVue's canvas layer.** v0.8.12 markers existed but at `r=3 / r=6 / fontSize=11 / z-10` they were easy to miss against bright/busy slices. v0.8.14: `r=4 / r=8 / fontSize=13 / z-20`, larger glow rings, stronger contrast.

### Added

- 🪟 **`level0ToCanvas(slideX, slideY)`** on the OSD viewer wrapper + PathologyViewerHandle — the inverse of `canvasToLevel0`. Calls OSD's `viewport.imageToViewerElementCoordinates` to project a level-0 slide pixel back to viewer-element CSS coords. The pathology marker layer reads it on every animation frame to track pan/zoom.

### Internal

- `src/lib/pathology/osd-viewer.ts` — new `level0ToCanvas(slideX, slideY)` impl + interface entry.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologyViewer.tsx` — exposes `level0ToCanvas` on `PathologyViewerHandle`.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologySamOverlay.tsx` — full rewrite: SVG marker layer, in-progress drag preview, animation-frame tick to re-project on pan/zoom.
- `src/components/SamPromptOverlay.tsx` — marker sizes bumped (r 6→8 / 3→4, fontSize 11→13); `z-10` → `z-20` so markers sit above NiiVue's canvas + crosshair.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 9s (36 precache entries, 5518 KiB).

### Honest deferred

- 📝 **Text prompts for SAM 3.** Worker currently filters out `kind: 'text'` prompts before packing the decoder input — needs a CLIP-style text encoder run + concat into the prompt embedding. Significant work; tracked for v0.9.x.
- 🎬 **"Encode all slices" pre-warm.** SAM is 2D; the v0.8.12 "Whole volume" propagation button is the workflow for full-volume masks via SAM. A separate batched pre-encode pass would speed up subsequent prompting but doesn't change capability — tracked.

## [0.8.13] — Preprocess actually honours the manifest's input size

### Fixed

- 🛑 **`Got: 1024 Expected: 1008` returned in v0.8.12** despite the manifest fix. Root cause: `preprocessSliceForSam` (and the RGB pathology variant) had `SAM_INPUT_HW = 1024` hard-coded inside the function body — the v0.8.12 manifest update set `size.input` to `[1008, 1008]` but the preprocessor still emitted a 1024×1024 tensor, then the worker tried to wrap it as `[1, 3, 1008, 1008]` and ORT rejected the shape mismatch.
- Fix: both preprocess functions take a `targetHW` argument; the SAM worker reads `manifest.size.input[0]` and passes it through. Default falls back to 1024 so any caller that hasn't been updated keeps the v0.7.x behaviour. Result: SAM 1 / 2.1 / MedSAM unchanged; SAM 3 actually runs at 1008×1008 now; BYO-URL models with arbitrary square input sizes (256, 512, 1024, 1536, …) just work without code changes.

### Notes for the user

- **3D models (TotalSegmentator, nnUNet, MONAI bundles).** These run through the **regular Inference panel** (not the SAM panel) — that worker passes the full 3D voxel tensor `[1, C, D, H, W]` directly to ORT, no per-slice resizing. Whatever 3D model you BYO, its declared input shape from the ONNX header is used as-is. SAM is 2D by design; the new "Whole volume" propagation button (v0.8.12) is the workflow for full-volume masks via SAM.

### Internal

- `src/lib/sam/preprocess.ts` — `preprocessSliceForSam(src, srcW, srcH, targetHW = 1024)`. Body uses local `T` instead of `SAM_INPUT_HW` constant. `scaleX/scaleY` returned correctly for the new size.
- `src/lib/sam/preprocess-rgb.ts` — same `targetHW` parameter on `preprocessRgbPatchForSam`.
- `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` — encode path reads `[inputH, inputW] = manifest.size.input` and passes `inputH` (SAM is square) to the preprocessor.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 9s (36 precache entries, 5516 KiB).

## [0.8.12] — SAM 3 dims · Prompt placement on HiDPI · "Whole volume" propagation

### Fixed — SAM 3 inference run-time error

- 🛑 **`Got invalid dimensions for input: pixel_values: Got 1024 Expected 1008`** — SAM 3 expects a **1008×1008** input (patch size 16 × 63 patches per side), not 1024×1024 like SAM 1 / 2.1. The v0.8.0 SAM 3 preset was copy-pasted from the SAM 2.1 entry with the wrong dims. Updated `inputShape` to `[1, 3, 1008, 1008]`, `embeddingShape` to `[1, 256, 63, 63]`, and `size.input` to `[1008, 1008]` so the preprocessor resizes to the right grid.

### Fixed — SAM prompt markers landed at wrong position on HiDPI

- 🎯 **Two coordinate-system bugs converged** to make the v0.8.11 marker overlay land in the wrong place — user reported "+ sign appears in pinch roi but cant see while selecting":
  1. **Click→voxel mapping ignored DPR.** `canvasToAxialVoxel(x, y)` passed CSS pixels to NiiVue's `tileMM`, which expects backing-store pixels (CSS × `devicePixelRatio`). On a 2× retina screen every click landed at half the intended canvas position; tileMM either returned wrong mm coords or null. Fix: scale up by DPR inside the wrapper.
  2. **Marker projection assumed full-overlay axial pane.** v0.8.11's `projectVoxel` mapped voxel→overlay-rect, which is correct only in single-plane sliceMode. In multiplane mode the axial pane is one quadrant — markers landed off-pane. Fix: query `getScreenSlices()` for the actual axial tile bounds (also DPR-aware) and project into THAT.

### Added — "Whole volume" SAM propagation button + plain-language explainer

- 🌐 **New "Whole volume" button** alongside ±5 / ±15. Walks every slice in the Z range (capped at ±200 ≈ 400 total) reusing the prior mask's bbox as a box prompt for each neighbour. Stops automatically when the propagated mask becomes empty (object boundary). User reported "encoding happens for only one slice and not the whole input" — SAM is 2D by design, but this completes the workflow for full-volume masking.
- 📝 **Plain-language explainer** above the propagation buttons: "SAM is 2D — encodes one slice. Commit + propagate to grow the mask across the volume; each new slice reuses the prior mask's bbox as a prompt." Resolves the "what does Phase D mean" confusion that the previous "Propagate (Phase D)" label caused.

### Internal

- `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` — SAM 3 preset gets `inputShape: [1, 3, 1008, 1008]`, `embeddingShape: [1, 256, 63, 63]`, `size.input: [1008, 1008]` plus a maintainer comment explaining the 1008-not-1024 detail.
- `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` — `canvasToAxialVoxel()` scales `(canvasX, canvasY)` by `devicePixelRatio` before calling `tileMM` so HiDPI clicks resolve correctly.
- `src/components/SamPromptOverlay.tsx` — `projectVoxel()` now reads the axial tile's `[x, y, w, h]` from `getScreenSlices()` and divides by DPR for CSS-px coords; correct in both single-plane and multiplane modes.
- `src/components/SamPanel.tsx` — propagation block restructured into three buttons (±5 / ±15 / Whole volume) with per-button tooltip + explainer line above.

## [0.8.11] — SAM prompt visibility · Encode-button guard · Real model sizes

### Added — SAM prompt visualisation

- 🟢 **Visual markers for SAM prompts on canvas.** Pre-v0.8.11 the SamPromptOverlay was invisible — clicking + or dragging a box added the prompt to state but the user saw NOTHING on screen ("the + sign appears in pinch roi but cant see while selecting the selected area"). Now an SVG layer renders:
  - Each placed point prompt → a coloured marker (green "+" for positive, red "−" for negative) at its voxel-mapped position
  - Each placed box prompt → a green outlined rectangle
  - During an in-progress box drag → a yellow dashed preview rectangle from start to current pointer position
- The SVG is `pointer-events-none` so it never blocks the click-capture div underneath. Animation-frame poll re-projects markers as the user pans / zooms / changes slice.
- Prompts are stored in source-axial voxel coords (unchanged from v0.7.x); the overlay projects to overlay-pixel space using the volume's dims + the overlay rect bounds — exact when the axial pane fills the overlay (the standard SAM workflow).

### Fixed — Encode button enabled with no volume → cryptic error

- 🛑 **"No slice loaded" / "No base volume loaded; cannot overlay a mask"** errors after clicking Encode/Run when no image was actually loaded. Pre-v0.8.11 the SAM Encode button was always enabled once a model loaded, so users without a primary volume hit the worker and got the opaque error. Now the button is greyed out + an inline amber hint says "No image loaded — pick a DICOM/NIfTI/NRRD on the left first, then come back."

### Fixed — Approx model sizes off by ~70×

- 📏 **`PRESET_SAM_MODELS.approxBytes*` refreshed from a live HEAD against the HF resolve URL** (2026-05-11). Old v0.7.x estimates were grossly wrong because they were for the un-quantized variants — onnx-community ships int8 + LZ4-compressed exports that are dramatically smaller:
  - SAM 2.1 Tiny: was 32 + 16 MB → now **441 KB + 290 KB**
  - SAM 2.1 Base+: was 80 + 16 MB → now **861 KB + 290 KB**
  - MedSAM: was 360 + 16 MB → now **101 MB + 4.9 MB** (closer; old est was for the float32 build)
- The user reported "the approx size of shown models and the size shows while downloading is so much different" — sizes shown in the OnboardingView buttons now match what the progress bar shows during download.

### Internal

- `src/components/SamPromptOverlay.tsx` — full rewrite of the rendering layer; click-capture logic kept; new SVG overlay reads `sam.prompts` + uses an animation-frame tick to re-project on every paint.
- `src/components/SamPanel.tsx` — `ReadyView` gains `volumeLoaded: boolean` prop; Encode button rendered with `disabled={!volumeLoaded}` + tooltip + inline hint when false.
- `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` — `approxBytesEncoder` / `approxBytesDecoder` updated for sam2-tiny, sam2-base-plus, medsam from real HF Content-Length values.

### Deferred to v0.8.12

- 🔁 **Cross-tab model sharing** (radiology ↔ pathology). Models already cache-share via OPFS/user-folder by sha256 — switching tabs hits the cache without re-downloading — but the user has to click the preset again. A "use the SAM model from the other tab" button would be cleaner; tracked.
- 🔄 **Tab content persistence on switch.** Pathology + Radiology have separate state in zustand (`sam` vs `samPathology`) but the React tree currently re-mounts on tab switch. Either lift state to a shared slice or keep both panels mounted with `display: none`.

## [0.8.10] — MPP override actually reaches the worker

### Fixed

- 🛑 **`Slide has no MPP metadata. Set MPP on the slide…`** still surfaced even after the user clicked v0.8.9's "Use this MPP" button. Root cause: v0.8.9 mutated `meta.mppX/Y` on the parent React state, but the inference worker re-opens the slide bytes via `openSlide({ bytes, filename })` and reads its OWN parsed meta — silently dropping the override at the worker boundary.
- Fix: route the override through `PathologyRunInputs.mppOverride` so the worker sees it directly. The worker prefers `loader.meta.mppX` when present (authoritative — header value), falls back to `inputs.mppOverride`, then bails. Slides that DO carry PhysicalSizeX/Y still use the header value untouched. Worker also patches `loader.meta.mppX/Y` post-resolve so downstream code paths (export, audit, tile arithmetic) see the calibrated value.

### Internal

- `src/workers/pathology-inference.worker.ts` — `PathologyRunInputs` gains `mppOverride?: number | null`; `slideMpp` resolution chain becomes `loader.meta.mppX ?? inputs.mppOverride ?? throw`. `loader.meta.mppX/Y` patched in-place when override used so subsequent geometry math is consistent.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologyInferencePanel.tsx` — `api.run({...})` call passes `mppOverride: meta.mppX` when set by the v0.8.9 "Use this MPP" button.

## [0.8.9] — Pathology in Files browser · Manual MPP override

### Added — Pathology slides + models in the recent-files history

- 📂 **Pathology slides + pathology models now log to the global recent-files history.** Pre-v0.8.9 the radiology image/model loaders went through `setVolume` / `setModel` which the v0.8.6 patch had wrapped to feed the `RecentFile` history — but pathology used local React state in `PathologyShell` and was invisible to the Settings → Files browser. Now both modalities feed the same history (`kind: 'image'` for slides, `kind: 'model'` for pathology models). The Files browser surfaces them with the same Show / Delete affordances.

### Added — Manual MPP override on PathologyInferencePanel

- 🎯 **MPP entry input** appears inline in the amber "missing MPP" warning. Pre-v0.8.9 the user had to convert the slide externally to OME-TIFF with PhysicalSizeX/Y filled in; v0.8.8 unblocked the run but didn't give the user a way to actually calibrate it. Now: type a µm/pixel value (typical scanner outputs: 0.25 for 40×, 0.5 for 20×, 1.0 for 10×), click "Use this MPP", and the in-memory `meta.mppX/Y` is set so the inference worker reads the calibrated value at run time. Range 0.05..10 µm/px (electron microscopy down to low-mag brightfield); step 0.01 for precision dial-in.

### Internal

- `src/components/pathology/PathologyShell.tsx` — `handleSlide` + new `handleModelLoaded` wrappers call `useAppStore.getState().addRecentFile()` so both slide + pathology-model loads feed the global recent-files history. PathologyExamplesPanel and PathologyModelPicker rewired to `handleModelLoaded`.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologyInferencePanel.tsx` — new `MppOverrideInput` sub-component; warning block restructured to include the input + the "Use this MPP" button; helpful magnification-to-MPP cheat sheet inline.

## [0.8.8] — Pathology tools unblocked: distance, brush, MPP-less inference

### Fixed

- 🛑 **Pathology distance + brush did nothing.** Pre-v0.8.8 we set `panHorizontal/panVertical = false` on the OSD viewer when a tool mode was active, but OSD's click-to-zoom + double-click-to-zoom-in handlers were still alive and **stole the press event** before our outer MouseTracker could see it. So:
  - distance click never deposited a `measureStart`
  - brush press never fired the brush handler
  - the right-click menu still surfaced (browser context menu)
  Fix: `viewer.setMouseNavEnabled(false)` whenever the user enters distance / brush / eraser mode, re-enable on pan. OSD's canonical "let someone else handle the mouse" switch — our MouseTracker on `viewer.element` keeps firing because it lives one level outside the disabled-nav layer.
- 🛑 **Right-click context menu** appeared on top of the slide and stole focus from any drag tool. Added a `contextmenu` listener on `viewer.element` that calls `preventDefault + stopPropagation`. Cleanup hook in `destroy()` removes the listener. Suppresses the menu in pan mode too — pathology workstations never use it.
- 🟢 **MPP-missing inference now allowed** with a softer warning. Pre-v0.8.8 the Run button was hard-disabled if the slide lacked PhysicalSizeX/Y in its OME-TIFF header — blocking inference on slides exported by older scanners or anonymisers. v0.8.8: button stays enabled, warning text reframed as informational ("output may be at an unexpected magnification — for calibrated results, convert to OME-TIFF with PhysicalSizeX/Y filled in"). The user accepts the limitation by clicking Run.

### Internal

- `src/lib/pathology/osd-viewer.ts` — `setDragMode()` now toggles `viewer.setMouseNavEnabled` per-mode; one-time `contextmenu` suppressor on `viewer.element` with cleanup in `destroy()`.
- `src/components/pathology/PathologyInferencePanel.tsx` — `ready` flag drops the `!missingMpp` gate; warning text rephrased.

## [0.8.7] — Pathology TDZ fix · slice-chip overlap · "Currently loaded" in Files browser

### Fixed

- 🐛 **`Cannot access 'brushCachedCanvas' before initialization`** — TDZ (temporal dead zone) error blocking pathology slide load AND the radiology brush layer. Root cause: the `let brushCachedCanvas` declaration in `osd-viewer.ts` was placed AFTER the `repaintOverlay` arrow (which transitively referenced it via `drawBrush`). OSD fires `update-viewport` / `animation` events synchronously during setup, so `repaintOverlay` ran BEFORE the `let` had executed → ReferenceError. Fixed by hoisting the declaration to the top of the closure scope (before `repaintOverlay`).
- 🪟 **Slice-chip overlap with the AppShell volume-metadata badge.** The "C 227/242" chip rendered at the top-left of the coronal tile, which is also where AppShell paints `256 × 242 × 154 · 0.72 × 0.72 × 1.00 mm · uint8`. Sagittal chip was getting hidden behind the AppShell crosshair pill. Fix: render chips at the **bottom-left** of each tile, with an 8 CSS-px breathing margin so they stay inside the tile and out of the header zone.
- 📐 **Slice chips at wrong positions on HiDPI displays.** NiiVue's `screenSlices.leftTopWidthHeight` is in canvas backing-store pixels (CSS × DPR). Pre-v0.8.7 we passed those values straight into a React `style` (CSS pixels), so on a 2× retina screen chips landed at twice the intended coordinates. Fix: divide by `window.devicePixelRatio` when computing the CSS positions.
- 📂 **Files browser appeared empty** for users upgrading from v0.8.5: the `RecentFile` history starts empty, and only fills as the user loads new files. Fix: new **"Currently loaded"** section at the top of the Files browser shows the active volume + model directly from store state (`store.volume.source` / `store.model.source`) so the panel always has at least one row when something is loaded.

### Internal

- `src/lib/pathology/osd-viewer.ts` — moved `let brushCachedCanvas: HTMLCanvasElement | null = null` from after the brush helpers (line ~567) to before `repaintOverlay` (line ~222). Comment in place explaining the TDZ root cause for future maintainers.
- `src/components/SliceChipsOverlay.tsx` — bottom-left positioning + DPR division + `maxWidth` clamp so chips don't escape narrow tiles in single-plane sliceMode.
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` — new `ActiveFileRow` component + "Currently loaded" group at the top of `FilesBrowserSection`.

## [0.8.6] — Per-pane crosshair lock · Fit 1:1 (real size) · Recent files · Workflow race fix

### Added — Per-pane crosshair lock

- 🖱️ **Settings → "Per-pane crosshair lock"** (default OFF). When enabled, clicking on the axial pane only changes Z (axial slice index); coronal click only changes Y; sagittal only X. The other two axes stay frozen. Resolves the user's "ax moving should be for the panel of series which the cursor is on" / "can't move y axis smoothly" requests.
- Implementation: `pointerdown` snapshots the crosshair triple + records which mosaic tile (via NiiVue's `tileIndex`) the click landed on; `pointerup` restores the OTHER two axes from the snapshot via `queueMicrotask` so NiiVue's click handler runs first. New wrapper helpers: `tileIndexAt()`, `snapshotCrosshair()`, `restoreCrosshairAxes()`.

### Added — Fit 1:1 (real life size)

- 📐 **Tools panel → "Fit 1:1"** button. Sets the 2D MPR zoom so 1 mm in the volume ≈ 1 mm on the user's screen, using the user-calibrated `pxPerMm` pref (default 3.78 = 96 DPI CSS-pixel convention).
- 🎯 **Settings → "Screen calibration (px/mm)"** — number input + Save + "Reset (3.78)". Recalibrate by measuring a known length on screen and entering the actual ratio. Range 1..20 covers laptop retina down to typical non-HiDPI desktop monitors.
- New wrapper method `fitOneToOne(pxPerMm)` writes both `scene.volScaleMultiplier` and `scene.pan2Dxyzmm[3]` so 2D + 3D stay in lockstep.

### Added — Recent files in Settings → Files browser

- 📂 **Recent files history** — every image / model / mask the user loads is logged to a `RecentFile` record with name + path (basename in PWA mode, absolute when Tauri picker is wired) + bytes + timestamp. Capped at 50 entries (LRU on add); persisted to `localStorage` (`tamias.recentFiles.v1`).
- 🪟 The Files browser section now shows a **second list** under the cached SAM blobs: one row per recent file with Show button (`revealPath()` → Tauri `revealItemInDir` on desktop, clipboard copy on browser).
- 🚮 **Clear** button wipes the history without touching cached blobs.

### Fixed — Workflow race (duplicate drafts)

- 📦 **New `create-draft` job runs FIRST** and emits `release_id`; the matrix builds upload to that specific release via `tauri-action`'s `releaseId` parameter instead of going through its racy "find by tagName, else create" path. The v0.8.4 incident (6 Linux assets in one draft, 10 mac+windows in another) cannot recur.
- Workflow re-runs reuse the existing draft instead of creating a duplicate.

### Internal

- `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` — `tileIndexAt()`, `snapshotCrosshair()`, `restoreCrosshairAxes()`, `fitOneToOne()`.
- `src/components/Viewer.tsx` — `pointerdown` snapshots crosshair when per-pane lock is on; `pointerup` restores via microtask; new ViewerHandle methods.
- `src/components/ToolsPanel.tsx` — new "Fit 1:1" button.
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` — per-pane lock checkbox, `DpiCalibrationSection`, recent-files list inside the existing Files browser.
- `src/lib/state/store.ts` — `UserPrefs.perPaneCrosshairLock` (default false), `pxPerMm` (default 3.78), new `RecentFile` type + `recentFiles` slice + `addRecentFile` / `clearRecentFiles` actions + localStorage persistence (`tamias.recentFiles.v1`). `setVolume` and `setModel` now log to recent files automatically.
- `.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml` — new `create-draft` job; matrix uses `releaseId`.

## [0.8.5] — Canvas-blank fix · 2D zoom (real fix) · distance units · Files browser · axis-coloured crosshair

### Fixed — v0.8.4 regressions

- 🖼️ **Canvas went blank after a single distance measurement.** v0.8.4's pointerdown/up capture for distance persistence triggered the v0.5.4-style canvas-blank race: NiiVue's measurement-mode pointerup left the GL state in a configuration where the React commit triggered by `addMeasurement` erased the canvas to backColor before the next `drawScene` tick. Fix: `requestAnimationFrame(() => nv.redraw())` immediately after the store mutation, both for distance AND angle commits.
- 🔍 **Zoom still didn't affect 2D MPR panes.** The v0.8.4 researcher pass said NiiVue 0.44 stores the 2D zoom multiplier on `nv.opts.pan2Dxyzmm[3]`. That was wrong — `resetView()` already wrote to `nv.scene.pan2Dxyzmm`, so the live one is on `scene`, not `opts`. v0.8.5 writes to `nv.scene.pan2Dxyzmm[3]`. The toolbar Zoom buttons + wheel/pinch zoom now visibly scale the 2D tiles.

### Added — Distance unit selector

- 📐 **Settings → "Distance unit"** chooser: mm / cm / px. Stored measurements stay in mm internally (NIfTI/DICOM convention); the unit only affects the SVG overlay's text labels. Switching unit doesn't lose precision. The 'px' option uses the smallest voxel spacing of the active volume as the reference.

### Added — Settings → Files browser with reveal-in-finder

- 📂 **List every cached SAM blob** (encoder, decoder, external-data sidecar) across both backends (user-chosen download folder + OPFS) with one row per file showing the full path, size, and a "Show" button.
- 🪟 **"Show" reveals the file in Finder/Explorer/the default Linux file manager.** Uses Tauri 2.x's new `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` (`revealItemInDir`). Required wiring:
  - `Cargo.toml`: `tauri-plugin-opener = "2"`
  - `lib.rs`: `.plugin(tauri_plugin_opener::init())`
  - `capabilities/default.json`: `"opener:allow-reveal-item-in-dir"`
  - `package.json`: `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener@^2.0.0`
- 🌐 **Browser fallback**: when running as a PWA (`window.open('file://...')` is blocked by every modern browser), the Show button copies the path to the clipboard and surfaces a "Path copied" hint so the user can paste it in their file manager.
- 🚮 **Per-row Delete** also wired: removes the blob from both OPFS and user-folder backends in one pass.

### Added — Axis-coloured crosshair

- 🎨 **Per-axis crosshair lines** (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue, matching the radiology orientation cube convention). Researcher confirmed NiiVue 0.44 has no per-axis crosshair color API (single global `crosshairColor`). Implementation: hide NiiVue's native crosshair (`alpha=0`) and overlay an SVG sibling layer that polls `getCrosshairTilePositions()` every animation frame, drawing two lines per visible MPR tile through the live crosshair point. Settings → "Axis-coloured crosshair" toggle gates it (default ON); turning off restores the v0.7.x yellow-orange single-color line.

### Internal

- `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` — fixed `zoomBy()` to write `scene.pan2Dxyzmm[3]`. New `setNativeCrosshairVisible()` and `getCrosshairTilePositions()`.
- `src/components/Viewer.tsx` — `requestAnimationFrame(redraw)` after every measurement commit. New ViewerHandle methods exposed.
- `src/components/MeasurementsOverlay.tsx` — `formatDistance()` honours `prefs.distanceUnit`.
- `src/components/AxisCrosshairOverlay.tsx` — new SVG overlay; mounted in `AppShell` next to MeasurementsOverlay.
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` — new `DistanceUnitSection`, `FilesBrowserSection`, axis-crosshair checkbox.
- `src/lib/fs/reveal.ts` — new helper; dynamic-imports `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` only when `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` is present so the PWA bundle doesn't pull it eagerly.
- `src/lib/sam/cache.ts` — `listSamBlobs(userDir)` + `deleteSamBlob(sha, userDir)` already accept the optional userDir from v0.8.2; reused by the Files browser.
- `src/lib/state/store.ts` — `UserPrefs.distanceUnit` (default 'mm') + `axisColoredCrosshair` (default true).
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` + `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` + `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` + `package.json` — all wired for `tauri-plugin-opener@2`.

### Deferred to v0.8.6

- 🖱️ **Per-pane crosshair lock** ("ax moving for the panel cursor is on") — needs a Settings toggle + non-trivial rewrite of NiiVue's click→navigate path.
- 📐 **100% zoom = real-life voxel/pixel size** — needs DPI math + tile-pixel-per-voxel calculation per pane.
- 🏷️ **Imported images & dropped DICOMs** in Files browser — the v0.8.5 pass surfaces only cached SAM models. Surfacing the in-memory imported volumes + their original file paths needs an FSA-handle-to-absolute-path bridge.
- 📦 **Workflow race fix** (v0.8.4 created two duplicate drafts) — gate the release-create step on a single "create-draft" job that emits the release ID for all platform builds to upload to.

## [0.8.4] — Angle/distance fixes · 2D zoom · screenshot panel picker · pinch sensitivity

### Fixed — Critical measurement bugs

- 🎯 **Angle tool: "can't click second point" + measurements never persisted.** Root cause: the v0.7.8 auto-commit logic registered a fresh `onAngleUpdate(cb)` subscriber after every `addAnglePoint()` call, then called `unsub()` inside the callback after first fire. The wrapper fires new subscribers IMMEDIATELY with current state — so the immediate fire hit `unsub()` before any subsequent click could trigger the listener. The third click's `addAnglePoint` then notified only the original subscribers (overlay + Tools panel) and the auto-commit-and-clear branch was never reached. Fixed by adding a synchronous `getAngleState()` getter on the wrapper and calling it directly after `addAnglePoint`. No subscriber dance.
- 📏 **Distance ruler didn't persist.** NiiVue's `dragMode='measurement'` is single-shot by design: the line is drawn during drag and erased on pointer-up. The v0.7.8 measurements store + SVG overlay existed but nothing fed it. New `pointerdown`/`pointerup` capture in Viewer.tsx — when `getDragMode() === 'measurement'`, mm at pointerdown is stored, mm at pointerup is read, and (if distance ≥ 2 mm) a `kind: 'distance'` measurement is pushed to the store. The MeasurementsOverlay SVG layer then re-paints across slice navigations, zooms, etc.

### Fixed — Zoom only affected 3D

- 🔍 **`zoomBy()` now updates BOTH `volScaleMultiplier` (3D) and `pan2Dxyzmm[3]` (2D).** Pre-v0.8.4 only the first was set, so toolbar Zoom +/− buttons and the wheel handler appeared to do nothing on the 2D MPR tiles. Researcher pass against NiiVue 0.44 internals confirmed the split. Both clamps are 0.25..16; `resetView()` already resets both to defaults.

### Added — Screenshot panel picker

- 📸 **Pick which panel to capture.** PNG button now opens a chooser with Axial / Coronal / Sagittal / 3D render / All panels. The per-tile capture uses `getScreenSlices()` to find the tile's canvas-pixel bounds, then clips the full canvas via OffscreenCanvas + re-encodes as PNG. Buttons for tiles that aren't currently visible (e.g. single-plane sliceMode) are disabled.
- 🪪 **Save behaviour preserved**: 'ask' mode prompts for a path each time; 'auto' mode writes to the user's chosen screenshot folder with silent fallback to 'ask' if the handle is stale. Default = 'ask' (user reported "if the user hasn't set the screenshot path... it should ask where to save it").

### Added — Pinch / wheel sensitivity in Settings

- 🎚️ **Sensitivity slider** (0.25× — 3×, default 1×) and **Reverse zoom direction** toggle. The Viewer.tsx wheel handler reads these prefs synchronously on every event so adjustments apply immediately (no remount). The previous hard-coded factors (0.0015 wheel, 0.003 trackpad pinch) become the base; the slider multiplies them.

### Internal

- `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` — new `getAngleState()`, `getDragMode()`, `takeScreenshotOfTile()`. `zoomBy()` extended to drive both 3D + 2D zoom factors.
- `src/components/Viewer.tsx` — added `pointerdown` listener for measurement-start capture; pointer-up handler simplified to use `getAngleState()` + `getDragMode()` directly. Wheel handler reads `prefs.pinchSensitivity` + `prefs.pinchInverted`.
- `src/components/ToolsPanel.tsx` — new `ScreenshotPicker` sub-component; PNG button now toggles the picker rather than capturing immediately.
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` — new `PinchSensitivitySection`.
- `src/lib/state/store.ts` — `UserPrefs.pinchSensitivity` (default 1) + `UserPrefs.pinchInverted` (default false).

### Deferred to v0.8.5

- 🪟 **Per-pane crosshair lock** (click on axial pane only changes Z, leaves X/Y alone). Researcher confirmed NiiVue 0.44 enforces tile constraint only during DRAG via `clickedTile`, not during single clicks. Fixing this needs a Settings toggle + non-trivial rewrite of the click→navigate path.
- 📁 **Settings → Files browser with reveal-in-finder.** Tauri 2.x supports `shell.open()` / `revealItemInDir()` via `tauri-plugin-shell`; needs a new permission + Settings UI listing OPFS/user-folder contents.
- 📐 **100% zoom = real-life voxel/pixel size.** Needs DPI math + tile-pixel-per-voxel calc; investigating.

## [0.8.3] — Monotonic progress bar · sticky-determinate

### Fixed

- ⚡ **Status bar still flashed multiple times within a single fast run.** v0.8.1 fixed the appear/disappear flash via `useThrottledBusy` (sub-150ms ops are now invisible; once shown the bar stays ≥400ms). But within a single run, the bar STILL filled-then-reset multiple times because every multi-stage loader emits per-stage progress events:
  - **SAM model load**: encoder fetch (0→100) → encoder external-data sidecar (0→100) → verify (no Content-Length, indeterminate) → cache → decoder fetch (0→100) → decoder external-data → verify → cache. The bar visibly drops to 0% (or to indeterminate animate-pulse) between every stage.
  - **Inference**: preprocess → infer → postprocess, each restarting at 0%.
  - **TotalSegmentator load**: same shape as SAM.
- The user reported v0.8.2 still had this multi-flash for fast runs, where stage transitions happen so quickly you see the bar repeatedly fill+reset within a few hundred milliseconds.

### Added — `useSmoothedProgress` hook

- 📈 **Monotonic + sticky-determinate progress smoothing.** New companion hook in `src/lib/ui/useThrottledBusy.ts`:
  - **Monotonic**: the smoothed fraction is `max(seen-so-far, current)`. The bar can never decrease within a single run. Multi-stage loaders look like a single 0→100 fill instead of N separate fills.
  - **Sticky-determinate**: once we've seen any non-negative fraction in this run, we never report indeterminate (-1) again. Stops the bar style from switching between determinate `<Progress>` and indeterminate `<animate-pulse>` when an intermediate stage like "verify" doesn't have a Content-Length.
  - **Reset on the active edge**: when `active` flips from false to true, both the max and the determinate flag reset. Monotonicity is per-RUN, not per-app-lifetime.
- Combined with `useThrottledBusy`'s 400ms hide-delay, the bar visibly fills to 100%, pauses at full, then yields to the success badge.

### Applied

- `InferencePanel` — smoothed `progress.fraction`, smoothed `hasDeterminate` flag drives the determinate/indeterminate render branch.
- `SamPanel.ThrottledSamBusyView` — smooths the per-event `busy.bytesLoaded / busy.bytesTotal` fraction, passes `smoothedPct` + `hasDeterminate` down to `BusyView` as props (BusyView no longer computes its own pct).
- `TotalSegmentatorPanel.ThrottledBusyView` — same pattern.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 8.0s (35 precache entries, 5489 KiB).

## [0.8.2] — User-chosen model download folder · Saved-to path visibility

### Added — Settings → Model download folder

- 📁 **User-pickable download folder.** Until v0.8.2 the SAM cache lived in **OPFS** (origin-private filesystem) — frictionless one-tap downloads but invisible to the user (can't browse the files, can't copy between machines, can't free disk space without DevTools). Settings now has a "Model download folder" section that lets you pick a real OS folder; downloads land in `<folder>/sam-cache/<sha256>.bin` instead. Same `pickDirectory()` + IDB-handle-persistence pattern as the existing screenshot folder, with a permission re-prompt after each reload.
- 📍 **Always-visible "Next download goes to:" target.** The Settings card renders the resolved write path via `describeWritePath()` so you know — before clicking Download in the SAM panel — whether the next blob goes to your folder or to OPFS. Works even with a stale handle (post-reload before the permission re-grant): we explicitly say "OPFS" so you're not surprised.
- 🛟 **Silent fallback to OPFS** when the user-folder write fails (permission denied, disk full, handle stale post-reload). Stops a stale handle from blocking downloads.

### Added — SamPanel "Saved to:" chip

- 🧾 **Cache write paths surfaced inline.** Every `loadSamModel()` call now returns `writePaths: { path, backend }[]` listing every blob it wrote (or hit from cache). The SAM panel renders these in a small monospaced chip under the model-loaded indicator: *"Saved to (your folder): MyModels/sam-cache/abc…123.bin"* or *"Saved to (browser private storage): OPFS:/sam/abc…123.bin"*. One row per file (encoder, encoder-data sidecar, decoder, decoder-data sidecar).
- 🚦 **Accurate busy-bar label** during the cache stage: *"Saving to MyModels/sam-cache…"* when a folder is picked, *"Caching to OPFS…"* when not. Replaces the v0.8.1 always-OPFS text that lied when a folder was picked.

### Internal

- `src/lib/sam/cache.ts` — `readSamBlob()` / `writeSamBlob()` / `deleteSamBlob()` / `listSamBlobs()` accept an optional `userDir?: FileSystemDirectoryHandle | null` and dispatch read+write to the user folder when set, OPFS otherwise. Reads check the user folder FIRST so a model the user explicitly downloaded "to disk" wins over a stale OPFS copy. Writes attempt user folder, fall back to OPFS on any error.
- `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` — `LoadSamOptions.downloadDir` plumbing; `SamModelBytes.writePaths` populated.
- `src/lib/state/store.ts` — `UserPrefs.modelDownloadDirHandle` + `modelDownloadDirName`. Handle persists in IDB (`MODEL_DIR_KEY`); display name persists in localStorage. Same handle-rehydrate IIFE as the existing screenshot folder.
- `src/lib/fs/idb-handle.ts` — new exported `MODEL_DIR_KEY` constant.
- `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` — new `ModelDownloadFolderSection` component.
- `src/components/SamPanel.tsx` — reads `modelDownloadDirHandle` from prefs, threads through both `loadSamModel()` call sites, captures and renders `writePaths`.

### Verified

## [0.8.1] — Progress-bar flash fix

### Fixed

- ⚡ **Inference progress bar flashed on fast operations.** Cached-WebGPU SAM encode + decode often complete in <100 ms. The `progress.active` flag flipped true → false within a single frame; the bar mounted, drew at some intermediate fraction, then unmounted before the user could register it had been there. UX was a brief strobe, not a "complete" state.

### Added

- 🎚️ **`src/lib/ui/useThrottledBusy.ts`** — generic hook with two thresholds:
  - **`showAfter` (150 ms default)** — only render the busy UI if the underlying flag stays true that long. Sub-150 ms ops feel instant; no spinner, no bar, no flash.
  - **`hideAfter` (400 ms default)** — once shown, stay on screen for at least this long after the flag flips back to false. The progress bar visibly fills to 100% (since the store holds `fraction: 1` post-success) before yielding to the success badge.
- Applied to:
  - `InferencePanel` — the panel the user reported the flash on (regular ONNX inference).
  - `SamPanel.BusyView` (via new `ThrottledSamBusyView` wrapper) — same pattern (cached SAM encode/decode).
  - `TotalSegmentatorPanel.BusyView` (via new `ThrottledBusyView` wrapper) — same pattern (Pyodide pre-warm + cached model loads).
- Each consumer mirrors the latest non-null `busy` snapshot in local state so we have something meaningful to render during the hide-delay window after the store's flag has cleared.

## [0.8.0] — SAM 3 one-tap · HuggingFace token · ONNX external-data · WASM isolation transparency

### Added — SAM 3 ships as a one-tap preset

- 🎯 **`SAM 3 (q4f16)`** is now a one-tap preset alongside SAM 2.1 / MedSAM. Source: `onnx-community/sam3-tracker-ONNX` (the Transformers.js-compatible export of Meta's SAM 3 tracker). Quantization: `q4f16` (~296 MB sidecar) — the smallest variant that fits in WebGPU memory on a 4 GB MacBook GPU without thrashing. Decoder: ~22 MB single-file ONNX. The original "SAM 3 (BYO URL)" entry stays in the list as the permanent escape hatch for community mirrors and lab-internal builds.

### Added — ONNX external-data format support in the SAM loader

- 📦 **External-data sidecar (`.onnx_data`) loading.** Pre-v0.8.0 the loader could only fetch single-file `.onnx` models — which is why SAM 3 had to live in the BYO panel. SAM 3's `vision_encoder_q4f16.onnx` is just the graph; the 296 MB of weights live in a sibling `vision_encoder_q4f16.onnx_data` file referenced via ONNX's `external_data_location` mechanism. The loader now fetches both files in sequence with separate progress reporting (`encoder-data` / `decoder-data` stages), caches both in OPFS keyed by sha256, and passes the sidecar bytes to ORT-Web via the `externalData: [{ path, data }]` session option. Schema additions on `SamModelSpec`: `externalDataUrl`, `externalDataFilename` (defaults to URL basename), `externalDataSha256`.

### Added — HuggingFace personal access token for gated repos

- 🔐 **HF token field in Settings** (Settings → "HuggingFace token"). Token is stored in `localStorage` (same path as the rest of `UserPrefs`), `type="password"` input + `autoComplete="off"` so it doesn't appear in plaintext on screen, never echoed back to the DOM after entry. Loader attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer …` ONLY on requests against `huggingface.co` — explicitly **not** on the redirected Xet/CDN hosts (those carry their own pre-signed query params and don't need the token; sending it would only widen the blast radius if Xet ever logs request headers). `Test` button hits `https://huggingface.co/api/whoami-v2` to verify the token's owner. `Clear` button wipes both the input and the persisted value.
- 🛑 **401 / 403 errors now suggest the token path.** Pre-v0.8.0 a gated-repo failure surfaced as `Fetch … failed: HTTP 401` with no actionable hint. Now: "This may be a gated repo — set a HuggingFace personal access token in Settings and retry." (or, if a token IS set, "Your HuggingFace token may lack access to this gated repo — check the repo page in a browser and request access.")

### Added — Multi-threaded WASM transparency (the WebKit COI question)

- 🧠 **Settings → "Multi-threaded WASM"** indicator. Reads `crossOriginIsolated` + `typeof SharedArrayBuffer` at runtime and surfaces:
  - Green: "Enabled (cross-origin isolated, SharedArrayBuffer available)" — typical PWA path under Chrome/Firefox/Edge.
  - Amber: "Disabled (single-threaded WASM only)" — typical macOS Tauri (WKWebView) path.
- For the amber case we explain **why** (WebKit Bug 230550 "Implement COEP:credentialless" still in NEW state as of 2026-05-11; researcher-confirmed, no movement since 2025-12-12) and **what to do** (open Tamias as a PWA in Chrome/Firefox for the 4–8× SAM-encode speedup). This replaces the v0.7.9 "deferred to v0.8.x" note with **honest user-facing transparency**, which is the best we can do until WebKit ships the spec.

### Notes on the resolved v0.7.9 deferred items

| Item | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| HF OAuth/token field for gated repos | ✅ Shipped | Settings input + scoped Authorization header in loader |
| ONNX external-data loader → SAM 3 one-tap | ✅ Shipped | Schema + loader + ORT-Web session + SAM 3 preset |
| macOS WKWebView COI | ⚠️ Surfaced honestly | Researcher-confirmed: WebKit hasn't shipped credentialless and has no Rust-side CORP injection. Best fix is runtime-detected indicator + workaround instructions in Settings — both shipped. |

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.

## [0.7.9] — Xet CSP fix · IPC dev unblock · SAM 3 URL pointers · Retry chip · honest TotalSeg messaging

### Fixed — Critical: HuggingFace Xet migration broke every model download

- 🛑 **`Refused to connect to https://cas-bridge.xethub.hf.co/...` blocked SAM/MedSAM/SAM-2.1 downloads.** HuggingFace migrated the LFS storage backend to Xet in early 2026 — every `huggingface.co/<repo>/resolve/main/<big-file>` now 302-redirects to `cas-bridge.xethub.hf.co`. Our CSP only listed `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co` + `cdn-lfs-us-1.huggingface.co`, so the redirect was rejected by the browser. Added `https://*.xethub.hf.co` and `https://cas-bridge.xethub.hf.co` to **both** `index.html`'s meta CSP (PWA + dev) and `tauri.conf.json`'s `app.security.csp` (desktop bundle). Confirmed via researcher pass: there's no documented HTTP header to opt out of Xet redirects per-request, so the only fix is to allow the Xet origin.
- 🔌 **`Refused to connect to ipc://localhost/plugin%3Aupdater%7Ccheck` floods on `npm run tauri dev`.** v0.7.5's IPC CSP fix only covered `tauri.conf.json` (desktop bundle); the dev server uses `index.html`'s meta CSP, which still missed `ipc:`/`tauri:`/`tauri.localhost`. Added all six entries to `index.html` so the auto-updater poll succeeds in dev mode.

### Added — SAM 3 known-export pointers in BYO panel

- 📚 **Inline citations of every working SAM 3 ONNX export.** The user reported "the SAM 3 is BYO link but there are also links to download it directly". Researcher pass confirmed:
  - `onnx-community/sam3-tracker-ONNX` — Transformers.js-compatible split. **Uses ONNX external-data format (`.onnx` + `.onnx_data` sidecar)** which the current single-file loader doesn't read; preset support lands in v0.8.x.
  - `vietanhdev/segment-anything-3-onnx-models` — single-zip ViT-H bundle (~3.41 GB, Apache-2.0). Closest one-tap drop-in via **Pick local manifest + ONNX**.
  - `facebook/sam3` — official repo, .safetensors only (no upstream ONNX).
- These options now render inline in the SAM 3 BYO form (amber chip with copy-pastable repo names).

### Added — Retry chip for failed SAM downloads

- 🔁 **One-tap "Retry" button** when a SAM model download fails. New `lastDownload` state captures the preset ID or custom-URL family on every download attempt; on failure the OnboardingView surfaces an amber "Last download attempt failed · Retry" chip that replays the same download.

### Changed — Honest TotalSegmentator messaging

- 📝 **Replaced the vague "No upstream ONNX export yet"** with the actual reason. Researcher confirmed: **no community ONNX export exists** — TotalSegmentator's 5-fold nnUNet ensemble with sliding-window inference can't be cleanly exported as a single ONNX graph. Recommended path is now spelled out: **run upstream TotalSegmentator (Docker / pip) → load the resulting `.nii.gz` mask back into Tamias as an overlay**.

### Deferred to v0.8.x

- 🔐 **HuggingFace OAuth / token field** for gated repo access (needs secure UI flow).
- 📦 **ONNX external-data format support** in the SAM loader (so SAM 3 ships as a one-tap preset).
- 🔄 **macOS WKWebView COI** — WebKit still doesn't honour COEP credentialless; nothing in-app can fix this.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 16/16 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle 8s (35 precache entries, 5475 KiB).

## [0.7.8] — Persistent measurements · per-pane slice chips · docs · Settings polish

### Added — Drawing on the canvas

- 📐 **Persistent multi-color angle measurements.** New `MeasurementsOverlay` SVG layer renders every committed angle on top of the NiiVue canvas. Color-coded: yellow vertex, red arm 1, blue arm 2 (matches the orientation cube convention). Each angle gets a delete X handle at the vertex. The in-progress angle (between clicks 1–3) shows the same colors as a dashed preview so the user can see what they're about to commit.
- 📏 **Persistent multi-distance measurements.** Same overlay, cyan dashed lines + endpoint dots + mm-readout label + delete handle. Distance entries persist across pan / zoom / slice scroll because they're stored in source-mm coordinates and re-projected to canvas pixels every animation frame.
- 🪟 **Per-pane slice number chips.** New `SliceChipsOverlay` reads NiiVue's private `screenSlices` layout array via the new `NiivueViewer.getScreenSlices()` wrapper helper and renders a small `<axis> <currentSlice>/<total>` chip in the top-left of each MPR viewport. The 3D render tile gets a `3D` label. Updates every frame so layout changes (single-plane / MPR / 3D / mosaic) are picked up immediately.
- 🪪 **Settings → Restore privacy banner.** v0.7.4 added a dismissable "No upload" header badge but the promised "re-enable in Settings" path never landed. It does now — once dismissed, a "Restore privacy banner" tile appears under Settings.
- 🤝 **Auto-commit angles.** Pre-v0.7.8 the angle tool held the three points in transient state and the user had to manually clear via Reset before drawing the next one. Now the third click pushes the angle to the persistent measurements store and resets the in-progress points so the next angle starts fresh.
- 🧪 **6 new vitest tests** for the measurements zustand slice (add / remove / clear / order / both kinds). Total test suite: **16/16 passing**.

### Added — Documentation

- 📚 **`docs/TOTALSEGMENTATOR.md`** — created. The TotalSeg panel UI links here from the help chip; v0.7.4 → v0.7.7 left the link broken (404 on the repo). Now covers all three runtime paths (native sidecar, BYO ONNX URL, Pyodide), one-time setup, supported tasks, security posture, troubleshooting + roadmap.
- 📖 **README updated** with TotalSegmentator + persistent-measurements highlights in the v0.7.x callout block.

### Internal — NiiVue wrapper API additions

- `NiivueViewer.mmToCanvas(mm)` — projects a source-mm point to canvas pixel coords by chaining NiiVue's private `mm2frac` + `frac2canvasPos`. Powers the SVG overlay's per-frame projection.
- `NiivueViewer.getScreenSlices()` — typed view over NiiVue's private `screenSlices` array. Returns each visible MPR tile's bounding rect + axis + current slice index + total count, derived from `nv.scene.crosshairPos`.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — **16/16 vitest pass** (10 totalseg loader + 6 measurements).
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 21.09s (5472 KiB precache).

### Known limitations (deferred to v0.7.9)

- **Distance capture from right-drag**. The current overlay renders persistent distance measurements that are stored in zustand, but capturing endpoints from the user's right-mouse drag (which currently triggers NiiVue's transient ruler) needs hooking the NiiVue measure callback. v0.7.9 wires that.
- **Auto-load TotalSegmentator masks** back into the viewer after the native runner finishes. Today the user has to manually point a file picker at the temp dir.

## [0.7.7] — Native TotalSegmentator runner (Tauri-only)

### Added — Real TotalSegmentator inference

- 🐧 **Native Python sidecar runner.** New Rust commands `totalseg_detect`, `totalseg_run`, `totalseg_read_mask` in `src-tauri/src/totalseg.rs`. The Tauri desktop build now spawns the user's locally installed `totalsegmentator` (or `python3 -m totalsegmentator`) as a subprocess, streams stdout/stderr line-by-line back to the frontend via the `totalseg-progress` Tauri event, and captures the resulting per-class NIfTI masks in a temp directory.
- 🧠 **Mac without CUDA works.** v0.7.6 framed TotalSegmentator as needing CUDA — that was wrong. PyTorch's MPS backend handles Apple Silicon and CPU fallback works on every Mac. The native runner uses whatever your existing Python install resolves to. Same workflow as the user's manual `pip install totalsegmentator` + CLI run, just driven from inside TAMIAS.
- 🪟 **`NativePyRunner` subcomponent** in `TotalSegmentatorPanel` replaces the v0.7.6 disabled-button explainer when run in the Tauri build:
  - Stage 1: detection — runs `totalseg_detect`; shows `pip install totalsegmentator` + relaunch instructions on miss.
  - Stage 2: ready — task selector (`total`, `lung_vessels`, `body`, `cerebral_bleed`, `hip_implant`, `coronary_arteries`, `pleural_pericard_effusion`) + `--fast` toggle.
  - Stage 3: running — live progress tail, capped at 200 lines (Rust-side cap matches UI cap).
  - Stage 4: done — output directory + mask filenames listed.
- 📦 **Pyodide path stays as a collapsed fallback** (`<details>` block, "browser-only, experimental"). Honest about its current dead end at SimpleITK; will start working when Pyodide closes the gap, no UI change needed.
- 🌐 **Browser PWA**: native runner card auto-degrades to "install desktop app for native Python integration" when `window.__TAURI__` isn't present. The PWA path keeps working unchanged.

### How to use it

1. Install TotalSegmentator on your machine: `pip install totalsegmentator` (or `pipx install totalsegmentator`).
2. Relaunch TAMIAS so PATH detection picks the binary up.
3. Load a CT volume in the radiology panel.
4. Open On-Prem AI → TotalSegmentator → load any manifest (BYO or local) to expose the runner card.
5. Pick a task + click Run. Progress streams in real time. Output masks land in a temp directory; auto-loading them back into the viewer ships in v0.7.8.

### Internal — Why no `tauri-plugin-shell` scope

The shell plugin requires whitelisting commands by argument pattern. TotalSegmentator's CLI grows new flags every release (subtask names, `--statistics`, `--quiet`). We bypass the plugin entirely and use `std::process::Command` from Rust — same security trust boundary (the user accepts the desktop install), much more future-proof. Custom Tauri commands are app-defined via `invoke_handler` and don't require capability gating.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 10/10 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 19.46s (5466 KiB precache).
- `cargo check` (Rust side) — compiles clean.

## [0.7.6] — Pyodide TotalSegmentator runner (experimental)

### Added — In-browser TotalSegmentator attempt

- 🐍 **Pyodide-based TotalSegmentator runner.** New `src/workers/totalseg.pyodide.worker.ts` + `PyodideRunner` subcomponent inside `TotalSegmentatorPanel`. Replaces the v0.7.5 amber explainer card. Stages: idle → license → init (Pyodide loads from jsdelivr CDN, ~10 MB) → install (`micropip.install("totalsegmentator")` + transitive deps) → ready / failed. Each stage streams progress + the verbatim install error back to the UI.
- 🪪 **Licence acceptance gate.** Before any Python boot, the user explicitly accepts: TotalSegmentator code (Apache-2.0) + model weights (CC-BY-NC-4.0) + Pyodide (MPL-2.0). The user asked for "just put in licence" parity with the upstream Python tool; this is the in-app version of that step.
- 📊 **Honest failure mode.** Today, `micropip.install("totalsegmentator")` is **expected to fail** at the SimpleITK / nnUNetv2 / torch dependency wall — those packages have no Pyodide WASM build. The runner attempts each transitive dep individually so the user sees which packages did install vs. failed, with each verbatim error in an expandable `<details>` block. When a future Pyodide release closes the gap, the same UI starts working unchanged — the worker is wired end-to-end (init → install → run).
- 🌐 **CSP allowlist updated** for Pyodide CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `https://files.pythonhosted.org`, `https://pypi.org` added to `script-src` and `connect-src` in both the Tauri shell config (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) and the PWA `index.html` meta CSP.

### Why not "fully automated TotalSegmentator" yet

The upstream Python tool runs TotalSegmentator in ~30s on a CUDA GPU because it ships nnUNet + PyTorch + SimpleITK + 200-500 MB of weights. In a browser via Pyodide:

| Dep | Pyodide status |
|---|---|
| `numpy`, `scipy`, `nibabel` | ✅ first-class Pyodide packages |
| `torch` | ⚠️ experimental WASM build, ~80 MB, CPU-only — not on jsdelivr CDN |
| `SimpleITK` | ❌ no WASM build at all |
| `nnunetv2` | ❌ not in Pyodide registry; pulls torch + custom ops |
| `dicom2nifti` | depends on `SimpleITK`, blocked |

So a literal `pip install totalsegmentator` in-browser today fails at SimpleITK. The v0.7.6 runner does the install attempt anyway, showing the user the exact wall — and remains the correct scaffolding for the day a community ONNX export of the nnUNet ensemble lands (in which case the existing BYO URL flow runs it via ORT, no Pyodide needed). Both paths now coexist in the panel.

### Still deferred to v0.7.7

- Persistent multi-distance measurements (NiiVue 0.44 ruler stores one at a time; needs a custom SVG overlay layer).
- Per-pane slice number overlays (one chip per MPR viewport; needs hooking NiiVue's `screenSlices` private layout).
- On-canvas drawn angle with multi-color arms (uses the same SVG overlay as multi-distance).

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` clean.
- `npm run lint` clean (`--max-warnings=0`).
- `npm test` — 10/10 vitest pass.
- `npm run build` — production bundle ships in 19.87s (5458 KiB precache, +10 KiB vs v0.7.5 from the new worker).

## [0.7.5] — SAM portal fix · wheel/pinch zoom · slice indicator · CSP/SW polish

### Fixed — Critical regressions

- 🎯 **SAM Box / Point modes wouldn't activate** in v0.7.4. Root cause: `SamPromptOverlay` was rendered as a sibling of the SAM `<Card>` *inside* the sidebar `<aside>`, so its `absolute inset-0 z-10` walked up the DOM looking for a positioned ancestor and ended up covering the entire viewport — blocking clicks on the SAM mode buttons in the sidebar AND landing in the wrong place when the user dragged a box in the viewer pane. Now mounted via `ReactDOM.createPortal` into `#viewer` (the `position: relative` `<section>` wrapping the `<Viewer>` canvas), so the overlay sits exactly where the user expects.
- 🎨 **SAM Text mode dropped prompts silently.** `sam.worker.ts` explicitly filtered `kind: 'text'` out of the decoder input, so the user typed text → status flipped to "encoded" → no mask appeared. Disabled the Text mode button with a tooltip explaining the missing text encoder, until a CLIP-style text encoder lands in a follow-up.
- 🛡️ **Tauri IPC plugin CSP block.** v0.7.4 saw `Refused to connect to ipc://localhost/plugin%3Aupdater%7Ccheck` on the auto-update poll because the CSP `connect-src` only listed the older `ipc:` + `ipc://localhost` + `http://ipc.localhost` triples. Added `https://tauri.localhost`, `http://tauri.localhost`, and `tauri:` to both `default-src` and `connect-src` to cover every Tauri 2.x IPC URL form.
- 🔇 **`coi-serviceworker` registration noise on macOS Tauri.** v0.7.3 removed the protocol guard hoping the SW could register on `tauri://` and proxy CORP onto HuggingFace responses. WKWebView blocks any non-http(s) `serviceWorker.register()` call, so the user got `TypeError: ... must be called with a script URL whose protocol is either HTTP or HTTPS` on every launch. Restored the `tauri://` skip in `public/coi-config.js` — the macOS desktop build stays single-threaded WASM until WKWebView honours `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless`, but the console is silent again.

### Changed — UX polish

- 🔍 **Wheel + trackpad pinch zoom** on every viewport (2D MPR + 3D render). Pre-v0.7.5 the user had to click the toolbar Zoom +/− buttons. New `wheel` listener on the canvas multiplies the existing scale by `exp(-deltaY × factor)`; trackpad pinch (which fires `wheel` with `ctrlKey: true`) gets a 2× multiplier so a single pinch travels noticeably. Clamped to ½..2× per event so a single fast pinch can't blow up the scale.
- 📊 **Per-axis slice indices** (`X 128/256 · Y 121/242 · Z 47/154`) replace the cramped `vox [128, 121, 47]` display in the floating crosshair pill. Per-pane labels (one chip per MPR viewport) ship in a follow-up — they need hooking NiiVue's draw cycle.
- 📐 **Persistent angle measurements.** Pre-v0.7.5 toggling Angle off cleared the prior points; now they survive until the user explicitly clicks the existing `Reset` button. Distance measurements already persisted via NiiVue's draw history.
- 🎨 **Smaller colorbar.** `colorbarHeight` shrunk from 0.025 → 0.012 (and `colorbarMargin` 0.015 → 0.01). Was eating ~30% of the viewer height at 4K with 36-px tick labels; now visible without dominating.
- 🖌️ **SAM mask color selector.** Pre-v0.7.5 the SAM commit + propagation pipeline always used green. New dropdown in the SAM panel ReadyView (red / green / blue / multi-label LUT). Choice flows through both `handleCommit` and `handlePropagate`.

### Fixed — TotalSegmentator panel cosmetics

- 🪪 **`TotalSegmentator (BYO URL) · Bring your own` overflowed the outline button.** Same shape as v0.7.1's SAM 3 fix: shortened the label to `TotalSegmentator` + `BYO` chip, with `truncate` + `min-w-0` on the inner spans.
- 🪟 **Yellow "See docs" badge wrapped weirdly** at narrow sidebar widths — the nested ExternalLink fought Badge's flex-row layout and tore at ~280px. Replaced with a plain `<a>` chip that reflows cleanly at every width.
- ❌ **The disabled "Run on current volume (preview)" button looked broken** ("still this button does nothing" in user testing). Replaced with an amber-tinted explainer card that's honest about the missing browser ONNX export + links to the upstream Python tool.

### Verified

- 🪂 **Drag-and-drop on every input picker.** Pre-v0.7.4 only the primary-image and secondary-series cards accepted a drop; the radiology + pathology ONNX model pickers required two click-through file dialogs. Now you can drop the `.onnx` and the `.json` manifest together (in either order) and the picker routes by extension. Drop one and we hold it pending the other so the click flow and the drop flow can be mixed freely.
- 📚 **Multi-DICOM series input.** New `Series…` button beside `Browse` on the radiology primary picker. Pick or drop multiple `.dcm` slices (Chromium: drop the whole folder) and the new `loadPrimaryFromFiles` wrapper hands them to `NVImage.loadFromFile([...])`, which orders by `ImagePositionPatient` and produces a single 3D volume. `pickFiles({multiple: true})` plus a multi-file `readDroppedFiles` adapter (with recursive `webkitGetAsEntry` walk) make this work in both browser PWA and Tauri builds.
- 🔍 **Loaded-images list with search.** New compact card under "Inputs" lists every loaded radiology image (140-px thumbnail · format badge · filename · size). The search input auto-shows once 2+ images are loaded — same UX as the cached-models filter. Pathology gets a parallel `LoadedSlidesList` under "Slide".
- 🛡️ **`No upload` banner is now dismissable.** Click the X to hide; the choice persists in localStorage (`prefs.dismissedNoUploadBanner`). Re-enable via Settings (next release).

### Added — On-Prem AI tab

- 🧠 **Renamed `SAM (assisted)` → `On-Prem AI`** in both modalities. The section now hosts both the existing `SamPanel` and the new `TotalSegmentatorPanel` so all on-device inference families live in one collapse. Future panels (nnUNet variants, MONAI bundles) land here without sidebar clutter.
- 🫁 **TotalSegmentator panel (preview).** Whole-body anatomical segmentation. v0.7.4 ships the manifest schema (`src/lib/totalseg/types.ts`), the loader scaffold (`src/lib/totalseg/loader.ts`) with streaming-fetch + progress callbacks, and the panel UI (onboarding · BYO URL form · loaded state). Inference runtime lands in a follow-up because the upstream upstream (https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) ships only Python / nnUNet weights — the BYO URL flow is the user-facing escape hatch for community ONNX exports.

### Added — Test kit + CI

- 🧪 **Vitest scaffold** (`vitest.config.ts`, `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`). 10 unit tests in `tests/totalseg.loader.test.ts` cover the manifest parser (4), the BYO builder (3), and the preset list shape (2). All 10 pass on CI and locally; coverage report is wired through `--reporter v8` for the `src/lib/totalseg/**` and `src/lib/sam/**` paths.
- 🤖 **CI now runs `npm test`** between `npm run lint` and `npm run build` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Failures block PR merges.

### Internal

- `pickFiles(accept)` and `readDroppedFiles(event)` are the new multi-file primitives in `src/lib/fs/filesystem.ts`. The single-file `pickFile` and `readDroppedFile` stay for backwards compatibility.
- `LocalFilePicker.onPickedMany?` is optional — callers that don't pass it see the legacy single-file behaviour, so nothing in the existing radiology / pathology inference paths regresses.
- `NiivueViewer.loadPrimaryFromFiles(items)` short-circuits to `loadPrimaryFromBytes` when the array has length 1, so the multi-file path doesn't pay the `File` allocation cost on single-volume picks.
- The TotalSegmentator manifest parser returns a deep-copied object (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(m))`) so callers can stash the parsed manifest in zustand without retaining a reference to the raw drop bytes.

## [0.7.3] — Cross-origin isolation on macOS Tauri + Angle/W-L coexistence

### Fixed — Critical UX regressions

- 🧵 **`crossOriginIsolated === false` on the macOS Tauri build.** v0.7.0/0.7.1/0.7.2 set `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` via `app.security.headers` so the WKWebView wouldn't block the Tauri custom protocol or HuggingFace fetches. But Safari/WKWebView **does not honour the `credentialless` value** the way Chromium does — `self.crossOriginIsolated` stayed `false`, `SharedArrayBuffer` was unavailable, and ONNX inference ran in single-threaded WASM mode (the WebGPU backend works either way; the regression is the WASM fallback path). Switched headers back to `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` AND removed the v0.7.2 "skip on tauri://" guard in `public/coi-config.js`, so `coi-serviceworker` now installs on the desktop app too. The SW intercepts every fetch and adds `CORP: cross-origin` to HuggingFace responses, which lets `require-corp` accept them. Net effect on macOS Tauri: `crossOriginIsolated === true`, multi-threaded WASM unlocked, HF downloads still work.
- 📐 **Angle button broke right-mouse-drag W/L.** Toggling the Angle tool in v0.7.1/0.7.2 forced NiiVue's `dragMode` to `'none'`, but `'none'` also disables NiiVue's right-mouse-drag W/L. Result: the user could not adjust window/level while measuring an angle. Removed the forced `setDragMode('none')` in `ToolsPanel.toggleAngle`. Kept the angle-vertex capture intact by tightening the `pointerup` filter in `Viewer.tsx` to `e.button === 0` only — left-clicks still drop angle vertices, but right-mouse drags pass straight through to NiiVue's W/L handler.
- 🖱️ **Stray angle vertices from right-clicks.** Same root cause: the v0.7.1 pointerup handler ignored `e.button`, so a right-mouse-up at the end of a W/L drag also dropped a third (unwanted) angle point. Now filtered to button 0.

### Why `require-corp` works in v0.7.3 (and didn't in v0.6.x)

The original argument against `require-corp` was that it blocks the Tauri custom-protocol IPC bridge and HuggingFace fetches. Both turn out to be solvable:
- Tauri custom-protocol responses are **same-origin** with the document, so they don't need a `CORP` header for `require-corp` to admit them.
- HuggingFace responses are cross-origin and don't carry `CORP`. The fix is to register `coi-serviceworker` on the `tauri://` scheme too, which we used to skip. The SW intercepts the response and adds `CORP: cross-origin`, which `require-corp` accepts.

`coi-serviceworker` already wraps `register()` in its own try/catch, so on Tauri builds where SW registration genuinely fails (older WKWebView, no SW support compiled in) the app silently falls back to the v0.7.2 single-threaded path — strictly an upgrade from v0.7.2.

## [0.7.2] — SAM URL fixes + BYO inline form + CSP-safe SW guard

### Fixed — Critical SAM-onboarding regressions

- 🔗 **SAM model 401/404 download failures.** All three preset URLs were broken: `onnx-community/sam2-hiera-tiny/resolve/main/onnx/encoder.onnx` 404'd (the file is named `vision_encoder.onnx` in that repo and the repo itself is older than the ONNX export); `sam2-hiera-base-plus` was a typo for the canonical `sam2.1-hiera-base-plus-ONNX`; `Xenova/medsam` 401'd because the org rotated the repo to `Xenova/medsam-vit-base`. Updated `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` to point at the working `onnx-community/sam2.1-hiera-{tiny,base-plus}-ONNX` repos with the actual `vision_encoder_quantized.onnx` + `prompt_encoder_mask_decoder_quantized.onnx` filenames. Verified each endpoint returns HTTP 200 before tagging.
- 📝 **"SAM 3 (BYO URL)" + "Custom URL…" buttons did nothing.** Both flows used three sequential `window.prompt()` calls to collect name + encoder URL + decoder URL. macOS Tauri (WKWebView) silently blocks `prompt()`, so the dialog never appeared and the buttons looked dead. Replaced with an in-card inline form (`name`, `encoder URL`, `decoder URL` inputs + Submit/Cancel) in both `SamPanel` and `PathologySamPanel`. The form lives inside the SAM card so the user never leaves the panel; Submit runs the same `loadSamModel` pipeline as a preset.
- 🪪 **"SAM 3 (bring-your-own URL)" label overflowed its outline button.** Renamed to "SAM 3 (BYO URL)" so the chip stays inside the button outline at the panel's narrow width.
- 🛡️ **CSP-blocked inline COI guard.** v0.7.0 added an inline `<script>` to skip `coi-serviceworker` registration under the Tauri `tauri://` protocol — but the strict CSP (`script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, no `'unsafe-inline'`) blocked it on every load. Externalised the guard to `public/coi-config.js` so the same logic runs without a CSP exception. SW registration is still skipped on `tauri://` (where headers are set natively) and runs on `http://`/`https://` (where the SW provides COOP+COEP).

### Internal

- Both `SamPanel` and `PathologySamPanel` now share a small `CustomUrlForm` subcomponent shape (3 inputs + 2 buttons). `PathologySamPanel` previously had no Custom URL flow at all — the BYO preset used to call `loadSamModel` against a `null` URL and fail silently; it now routes the same way the radiology panel does.

## [0.7.1] — Global undo stack + Angle measurement tool

### Added — Centralised undo for tools + settings
- ⌨️ **Global Cmd-Z / Ctrl-Z** now undoes any reversible UI mutation (slider releases, mode switches), not just brush strokes. Cross-OS via `e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey`. Brush undo stays separate (NiiVue's draw-history `drawUndo()`); the two handlers don't collide because the brush handler only attaches when brush/eraser/smart mode is active.
- 🧰 New `undoStack: UndoEntry[]` slice on the zustand store with `pushUndo({label, revert})` + `popUndo()`. `revert()` is closure-captured at push time — no inverse-delta bookkeeping needed for coarse-grained UI mutations. Cap at 50 entries; oldest dropped silently.
- 🪪 Producers wired in v0.7.1: **mask opacity slider** (one undo per pointer-down → pointer-up drag, gated so per-mousemove ticks don't pollute the stack) and **mask colormap selector**. More producers (W/L sliders, layout mode switches, drag-mode changes, distance ruler clear) follow in subsequent v0.7.x patches as the same pattern is applied to each panel.

### Added — Angle measurement tool (3-click, mm-space)
- 📐 New **Angle** button in the radiology Tools panel. Click vertex → first arm endpoint → second arm endpoint. Status pill walks through each click (`Click on a 2D slice to set the vertex.` → `Click to set the first arm endpoint.` → `Angle: 67.3° · vertex (12.4, 34.7, 56.0) mm`).
- 🧮 NiivueViewer wrapper gains `setAngleMode(on)`, `addAnglePoint(mm)`, `clearAnglePoints()`, `onAngleUpdate(cb)` and `AngleState` type. Vectors computed in mm-space (physical real-world coords, not voxel grid) so the angle is independent of slice spacing or anisotropy. Formula: `acos((a₁·a₂) / (|a₁|·|a₂|))` clamped to `[-1, 1]` to avoid floating-point NaNs at colinear points.
- 🖱️ Click capture piggybacks on the existing pointerup listener in Viewer.tsx + a probe-stream cache of the latest mm coordinate. Drag mode auto-flips to `'none'` while in angle mode so click+drag doesn't also pan/contrast.
- 🧹 Reset clears captured points but stays in angle mode. Toggling Angle off clears state entirely.



### Fixed — v0.7.0 polish (caught during pre-publish smoke-test)

- 🛑 **`npm ci` lockfile drift unblocked.** First v0.7.0 build (commit `e62a1f7a`) failed on all four platforms with `lock file's source-map@0.7.0 does not satisfy source-map@0.6.1`. Regenerated `package-lock.json` via `npm install --package-lock-only` — six-line diff (added the nested `source-map@0.6.1` resolution that `source-map-support` requires). v0.7.0 re-cut on a clean lockfile.
- 🌗 **Dark-mode button contrast.** `outline` + `ghost` variants in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` had zero `dark:` overrides — unselected Tools/Layout buttons rendered as "barely-visible white card" against the dark slate panels. Added explicit `dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 dark:border-slate-600`. `ink` variant gets a matching `dark:bg-slate-700`. Every state stays legible at every contrast level.
- 🛡️ **Defensive WebGL recovery in the Viewer.** Three new event listeners in `src/components/Viewer.tsx`: `webglcontextlost` (with `preventDefault()` so the browser treats the loss as recoverable rather than permanent — Tauri WKWebView evicts contexts under memory pressure when CT + 3D + concurrent SAM encoder are active), `webglcontextrestored` → `redraw()`, and `pointerleave` → deferred `redraw()` (defends against the v0.5.4-family cursor-leave-blanks-canvas bug for tool / context-menu cases that bypass the brush-only `refreshDrawing` gate from v0.5.5). `NiivueViewer.redraw()` is the new public unconditional re-paint method.
- 🔌 **Multi-threaded WASM in the desktop WebView.** Added `app.security.headers` block to `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` + `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`. The browser PWA already gets these from `scripts/serve.mjs` (and from `coi-serviceworker` as a fallback on hosts that strip them); the Tauri custom protocol bypassed the static server, so the WebView ran without `crossOriginIsolated`, falling back to single-threaded WASM. With the headers in place `self.crossOriginIsolated === true` in both modes and inference uses up to 8 threads.
- 🔔 **Updater banner no longer leaks raw markdown.** `UpdatePrompt.tsx` previously rendered `latest.json.notes` with `whitespace-pre-wrap`, so the user saw `## 🐿️ TAMIAS v0.5.7` literally, mid-word truncation, and stray table pipes. Strip headings / table rows / bullets / raw HTML, join with `·`, hard-cap at 280 chars, full markdown still available on the title tooltip.
- 🪪 **Stale modality-toggle tooltip** — "preview, full release in v0.6.0" → "OpenSeadragon + OME-TIFF / SVS / NDPI + tile-based ONNX inference" (the actually-shipped feature description).


> First release with click + box + text prompted segmentation, in **both** Radiology and Pathology modes. Architecture is identical across modes: one shared `src/lib/sam/` infrastructure (manifest, loader, OPFS cache, session wrappers) plus one shared `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` that branches on `inputMode: 'gray' | 'rgb'` to pick the radiology (auto-window grayscale) vs pathology (RGB) preprocessor. No upload, weights cached in OPFS, SAM 3 ONNX URL slot ready for when a stable export ships. **CSP widened to allow `huggingface.co` + `*.huggingface.co` + `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co`** for opt-in weight download — every fetch is user-triggered, nothing fires automatically.

### Added — SAM (Segment Anything) for Radiology AND Pathology

**Phase A — Scaffolding**:
- 🧠 `src/lib/sam/` — `SamManifest` schema, prompt types (point / box / text), `SamMaskResult`, OPFS cache, worker envelopes.
- 🗂️ `docs/SAM.md` — full plan: HuggingFace ONNX exports table (SAM 2 Tiny / Base+ / MedSAM, SAM 3 stub), encoder-once + decoder-per-prompt architecture.

**Phase B — Runtime ONNX wiring (Radiology)**:
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/preprocess.ts` — slice auto-window → 1024² ImageNet-normalised tensor.
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/postprocess.ts` — bilinear up-sample + threshold + best-IoU pick.
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` — streaming HuggingFace fetch with progress, sha256, OPFS.
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/session.ts` — encoder + decoder ort wrappers, WebGPU → WebNN → WASM fallback, prompt-tensor packer.
- ⚙️ `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` — Comlink `encode()` + `decode()` + `reset()`; module-scope session cache.
- 🩻 `src/components/SamPanel.tsx` + `SamPromptOverlay.tsx` + `niivue.ts` helpers — full UI flow: click-capture → encode → prompts → generate → preview with IoU → commit through existing `addMaskOverlay` (inherits the v0.5.5 RAS-alignment fix).

**Phase B' — SAM-on-Pathology (NEW)**:
- 🪄 `src/lib/sam/preprocess-rgb.ts` — RGB preprocessing (no auto-window; resize + ImageNet-normalise + HWC→CHW). Used by pathology where slides are already RGB.
- 🩻 `src/components/PathologySamPanel.tsx` + `PathologySamOverlay.tsx` — pathology variant: pick ROI on the slide → read a 1024² tile from level-0 → encode → prompts in level-0 pixel coords → mask committed via `setMaskOverlay`.
- 🩻 `src/components/pathology/PathologyViewer.tsx` — `PathologyViewerHandle` extended with `readLevel0Region` + `canvasToLevel0` for SAM ROI scoping.
- 🩻 `src/lib/pathology/osd-viewer.ts` — `readLevel0Region(x, y, w, h, targetW, targetH)` proxies to the underlying `TileLoader`.
- ⚙️ `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` — `encode()` extended with `inputMode: 'gray' | 'rgb'` discriminator that picks the correct preprocessor. Decoder unchanged.
- 🩻 `src/components/pathology/PathologyShell.tsx` — new "SAM (assisted)" sidebar section between Inference and Tools.
- 🧠 `store.ts` — separate `samPathology` slice mirrors `sam` so the two viewers stay independent (loading SAM in one doesn't auto-load it in the other).

**Phase C.1 — Smart brush handoff** (radiology):
- 🪄 `AnnotationPanel.tsx` points users at the SAM panel for click-to-mask assisted segmentation.

**Phase C.2 — Single-stroke smart-brush** (radiology):
- 🪄 New **Smart** mode in `AnnotationPanel.tsx` alongside Brush/Eraser. One click on a 2D slice → SAM encode + decode with that single positive point → mask committed straight into the brush layer at the active label, no Encode/Generate/Commit buttons.
- 🪛 Capture happens at the document level in capture-phase so NiiVue's own draw handlers don't fire; drawing is also explicitly disabled while in smart mode to prevent stray voxel-paints during slow encodes.
- 🔒 The Smart button is disabled until a SAM model is loaded; tip box adapts copy depending on whether SAM is offline.
- 🎯 Reuses `addMaskOverlay()` so the mask inherits the v0.5.5 RAS-alignment fix in 2D + 3D.

**Phase D — Cross-slice mask propagation** (radiology):
- 🧭 SamPanel preview block gains **±5 slices** and **±15 slices** propagate buttons that walk neighbour slices (interleaved ±1, ±2, …, ±N), re-encode each, and decode using the previous slice's mask bbox as a box prompt.
- 🛠️ `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` + `src/components/Viewer.tsx` expose `getAxialSliceAt(z)` so the propagator can pull arbitrary slices without scrolling the user's crosshair.
- 🩹 Bbox is re-tightened from each new mask each iteration; propagation stops early when a slice produces an empty mask. Multi-slice mask is committed via a single `addMaskOverlay` call.
- ⚖️ Intentionally simpler than SAM 2's video tracker — works with any backbone, single decode call per slice.

**Phase E — Auto-save folder for screenshots**:
- 📸 `pickDirectory` + `saveBytesToDirectory` in `src/lib/fs/filesystem.ts`. Settings panel folder picker. ToolsPanel writes straight there when `prefs.screenshotMode === 'auto'`.

**Phase E.2 — IndexedDB-backed handle persistence**:
- 💾 New `src/lib/fs/idb-handle.ts` — `readStoredHandle` / `writeStoredHandle` / `deleteStoredHandle` / `requestHandlePermission` over a small `idb`-style direct-request API (no extra dep). DB `tamias-prefs`, store `handles`, version 1.
- ⚙️ `SettingsPanel.tsx` writes the handle on Pick and exposes a **Forget** button that deletes both IDB and in-memory copies.
- 🚀 `store.ts` rehydrates the handle on app boot, queries+requests `readwrite` permission, silently falls back if either step fails (e.g. user revoked access in browser settings).

**Phase F — SAM 3 placeholder + Custom URL onboarding**:
- 🪪 New 4th preset entry `sam3-byo` in `loader.ts`; `family: 'sam3'`, supports `['point', 'box', 'text']`, both encoder/decoder URLs `null` (BYO).
- 🧪 New `buildCustomSamManifest({ name, encoderUrl, decoderUrl, family?, expectsText? })` synthesises a manifest at runtime.
- 🪄 SamPanel onboarding routes the SAM 3 preset through a Custom URL flow (prompts for name + encoder URL + decoder URL); a dedicated **Custom URL…** button at the bottom of the onboarding view supports any other ONNX export.
- 🌉 Bridge for SAM 3 once Meta publishes a stable ONNX export — no app rebuild required.

### Changed — CSP for opt-in SAM weight download
- 🔌 `connect-src` adds `huggingface.co` + `*.huggingface.co` + `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co`. **Always user-triggered**; nothing fetches automatically.

### Notes
- Branch `feat/sam-radiology` merged to `main` via PR #3 (commit `2b011088`). Branch retained for history.
- All planned phases (A, B, B′, C.1, C.2, D, E, E.2, F) shipped. Out of scope for v0.7.0: 3D-native SAM (SAM-Med3D / MedSAM-3D) — deferred to a later v0.7.x patch; SAM 2 video-tracker temporal embeddings — superseded for now by Phase D's bbox-carry-forward propagator.
- Model licensing: TAMIAS does not bundle SAM weights. Users either bring their own ONNX export or trigger the one-click HuggingFace download. **Meta's SAM 2 weights are released under Apache 2.0; MedSAM weights are released under Apache 2.0**; see `docs/SAM.md` for the full HuggingFace export table and per-checkpoint license confirmation.

## [0.6.1] — One-click pathology examples + bundled tissue-mask ONNX

### Added
- 🧪 New `Examples` section in the Pathology sidebar (between Slide and Model). One-click **Download** + **Load into app** mirrors the radiology example kit — no file picker, no manual download.
- 🧠 `examples/pathology/tissue_mask.onnx` (448 B, hand-built, opset 17, validated by `onnx.checker`). Architecture: `image[1,3,h,w] → ReduceMean → Sub → Mul → Concat → seg[1,2,h,w]` — argmax across class dim returns 1 for pixels darker than the imagenet mean (= H&E-stained tissue). CC0.
- 🧰 `src/lib/fs/pathology-examples.ts` — OPFS-backed loader mirroring `src/lib/fs/examples.ts`, dedicated OPFS root (`tamias-pathology-examples`).
- 🧰 `src/components/pathology/PathologyExamplesPanel.tsx` — Download / Cached / Load-into-app / Remove-all buttons.

## [0.6.0] — Pathology mode (Phase A + B + C)

### Added — Pathology mode replaces the v0.5.7 placeholder
- 🔬 **OpenSeadragon-based whole-slide viewer** with a custom in-memory
  tile bridge. Tiles never touch the network — the bridge intercepts
  OSD's `downloadTileStart` and serves canvases painted from the loaded
  tile loader's RGBA bytes. Ships a 2-D navigator inset (bottom-right),
  pan / zoom / fit / 1:1 controls, and a screenshot composer that
  combines the OSD draw canvas with our overlay canvas.
- 🧬 **OME-TIFF loader** (`geotiff.js`). Walks the IFD list, identifies
  the pyramid chain by monotonic-decreasing area, parses OME-XML
  `PhysicalSizeX/Y` for MPP (with µm / nm / mm / cm unit handling), and
  exposes `readTile` + `readRegion` — the latter automatically picks the
  closest pyramid level for the requested downsample, then resamples to
  target size via canvas bilinear.
- 🧬 **Aperio SVS + Hamamatsu NDPI direct loading** through the same
  pyramidal-TIFF path. Vendor MPP is recovered from:
  - the Aperio `MPP = 0.25` token in `ImageDescription` for SVS, and
  - TIFF `XResolution` / `YResolution` + `ResolutionUnit` for NDPI
    (and any other plain pyramidal TIFF that exposes resolution tags).
  Slides that hit a vendor extension `geotiff.js` can't decode (NDPI
  > 4 GB with `NDP_OFFSET_HIGH`, JPEG2000-encoded SVS) fall through to
  a clear error dialog with the `bioformats2raw + raw2ometiff` recipe
  pre-filled. No OpenSlide-WASM binary is shipped — every byte is
  decoded by a pure-JS / WASM TIFF reader so there's no native binary
  to sign or audit.
- 🧬 **Single-file fallback** (PNG / JPEG / non-pyramidal TIFF). Decodes
  once into an `OffscreenCanvas` (or `HTMLCanvasElement` on older
  browsers), then services tile reads via `getImageData`. Capped by
  the browser's canvas size limit (~16 384 px / axis).
- 📏 **Distance ruler in microns**. Switches OSD into a non-panning
  mode, draws an amber ruler with end caps, and labels the mid-line in
  µm (or mm, when the measurement is ≥ 1 mm). Falls back to pixels when
  the slide has no MPP metadata.
- 🛠️ **Pathology Tools panel** (Pan / Distance / Zoom +/− / Fit / 1:1 /
  Reset / Screenshot). Same idiom as the radiology toolbar.
- 🧠 **Tile-based ONNX inference worker** with strict pathology
  manifest validation. Walks the ROI in `patch × stride` steps, requests
  patches at the manifest's MPP via `readRegion`, runs ONNX, and stitches
  results by output kind:
  - `segmentation` → per-pixel argmax into a label map (last-write-wins
    in overlap regions; Gaussian soft-blending tracked as follow-up).
  - `classification` → one (label, score) per patch + label-painted
    heatmap so the overlay renders consistently across output kinds.
  - `heatmap` → per-pixel score (×255) accumulated and averaged across
    overlapping patches.
  - `detection` → list of (x, y, label, score) records per patch.
- 📋 **Pathology manifest schema** (`mpp`, `patch`, `stride`,
  `channelOrder`, `normalization`, `output.type`, `output.labels`,
  `output.colors`, `preferredEP`, `sha256`). Validated strictly with the
  same idiom as the radiology manifest parser; the first malformed
  field fails loudly.
- 📤 **Result PNG + sidecar JSON export**. PNG renders the result
  buffer through the manifest's colour table (matching the on-screen
  overlay). JSON sidecar records slide name, model name + SHA-256, MPP,
  ROI, output kind, ONNX provider, attempted providers, and wall-clock
  duration. Carries the standard "Research Use Only" stamp.
- 📜 **OPFS audit log entry per pathology run** (`kind: 'inference'`)
  with the same fields the radiology side already records.

### Added — Modality toggle is now functional
- 🔬 The header **Pathology** toggle now mounts the full pathology
  shell (sidebar + viewer) instead of the v0.5.7 placeholder card.
  Switching modes preserves the sidebar's collapsed state and width.

### Added — Examples + docs
- 🧪 `examples/pathology/README.md` — pointers to public-domain WSIs
  (CAMELYON16, PANDA, TCGA, HuBMAP) with conversion recipes for SVS /
  NDPI via `bioformats2raw + raw2ometiff` or QuPath.
- 📋 `examples/pathology/tissue_mask.json` — reference manifest
  exercising every schema field.
- 📚 `docs/PATHOLOGY.md` — full pathology mode documentation
  (capabilities, limits, manifest reference, inference pipeline).

### Added — Slide brush + eraser (Phase B)
- 🎚️ **Six-colour brush + eraser** on the slide overlay, mirroring the
  radiology brush palette (red / green / blue / yellow / cyan / magenta).
  Strokes paint into a per-slide buffer capped at 4 096 × 4 096 (the
  slide's bounding rectangle, mapped 1:1 to that resolution) so paint
  stays memory-bounded even on 100 k × 100 k slides.
- ↶ **Per-stroke undo** (16-deep stack) and **Clear all**.
- 🎨 **Brush radius slider** (1 – 256 slide-level-0 pixels).
- 📤 **"Save brush colours" export** writes one transparent-background
  PNG per painted colour (`__brush_red.png`, `__brush_green.png`, …)
  via the same File System Access API path as the rest of the
  pathology export panel.

### Added — Phase C polish
- 🧪 **Bundled synthetic H&E sample** (`examples/pathology/synthetic_he_512.png`,
  ~ 212 KiB). Procedurally generated by `scripts/build-pathology-sample.mjs`
  (CC0, no real patient data) so users can exercise the viewer + brush
  + tile inference pipeline end-to-end without downloading a real WSI
  first. Sidecar `synthetic_he_512.json` declares 0.5 µm/px (20× scan
  equivalent) for the distance ruler.
- 🩻 **Hero banner refresh** covers both modalities — the strapline now
  mentions OME-TIFF / SVS / NDPI alongside DICOM / NIfTI / NRRD, and a
  green PATHOLOGY pill joins the badge row.

### Deferred to a follow-up release
- 🌡️ Gaussian soft-blending of overlapping segmentation patches
  (currently last-write-wins).

### Dependencies
- ➕ `openseadragon` 6.x for the pyramidal viewer.
- ➕ `geotiff` 3.x for OME-TIFF / TIFF decoding.

## [0.5.7] — Radiology polish · Modality toggle · v0.6.0 groundwork

### Added — Radiology toolbar polish
- 🔍 **Zoom in / out** buttons in the Tools panel (1.25× / 0.8×, clamped 0.25–16). Wraps NiiVue `scene.volScaleMultiplier`.
- 📸 **Screenshot button** captures the current canvas (overlay + crosshair + 3D composited) as a PNG via `canvas.toBlob` + the existing FSA save path.
- 🔎 **Cached-models search bar** in the Model picker — appears once you have 5+ cached models and filters case-insensitively across name, version, modality.

### Added — Modality toggle (Pathology placeholder)
- 🔬 **Modality segmented control** in the header (Radiology · Pathology). Pathology renders a placeholder card with a roadmap link — the full implementation lands in v0.6.0. The toggle exists in v0.5.7 so the pathology track is discoverable and roadmappable from inside the app.

### Fixed — Workflow pattern matching
- 🛠️ **`alias-assets` is now productName-agnostic.** v0.5.6 broke when `productName` changed from `TAMIAS` to `Tamias`: tauri-action started writing files like `Tamias_0.5.6_aarch64.dmg`, but the workflow had `TAMIAS_*` patterns hardcoded, so the alias mirror + `latest.json` reassembly silently no-op'd, leaving 21 assets and an empty `latest.json`. The patterns now use a generic capture group (`*_*`) and the `latest.json` step derives the prefix dynamically from the discovered `.sig` files.
- 🚫 **v0.5.6 release reverted to draft** so installed users don't auto-update to a release with a broken `latest.json`. v0.5.5 stays as `releases/latest`. v0.5.7 supersedes both.

## [0.5.6] — Radiology toolbar · sidebar preview · brush-per-colour · icon polish

### Added — Tools panel
- 🛠️ **New "Tools" sidebar section** — drag-mode toolbar (Default / W-L / Pan / Distance) wired to NiiVue's `DRAG_MODE`. Distance ruler shows mm read-out at the cursor.
- 🩻 **Outline toggle** for the AI mask — re-renders the mask as a 1-voxel-thick boundary instead of a solid fill, so anatomy underneath stays visible. Reversible client-side (no inference re-run).
- ↺ **Reset** — zoom 1.0, crosshair to centre, default W/L.

### Added — Sidebar volume preview
- 🩻 **Mid-axial-slice thumbnail** under the loaded volume name (LocalFilePicker). Auto-windows on the slice's 1st/99th percentiles so dark CTs and bright MRs both render legibly. ~10 ms render, no GL.

### Added — Brush per-colour export
- 🎨 **"Save brush colours" button** in Export — splits the drawn bitmap by label index and writes one binary `.nii` per painted colour (`__brush_red.nii`, `__brush_green.nii`, …). Each colour becomes a standalone mask suitable for ITK-SNAP / training-label workflows.

### Changed — App identity
- 🍎 **Icon padding** matches Apple's app-icon template (~10% transparent inset on each edge of the 1024² frame). The squirrel no longer looks visibly larger than every other app in the macOS Dock.
- 🪪 **`productName` "Tamias"** (title case) — the macOS bundle's `CFBundleDisplayName` now reads "Tamias" in Dock hover, Finder, and the menu bar app name. (Note: this rename is what triggered the v0.5.6 alias-assets regression — fixed in v0.5.7.)

## [0.5.5] — General-model 3D alignment · cursor-leave blanking fix

### Fixed
- 🧭 **3D mask alignment now works on arbitrary source NIfTIs.** The v0.5.3 `matRAS` clone fixed axis-aligned volumes but still drifted on LPI MRs and oblique CTs. v0.5.5 also clones `dimsRAS`, `pixDimsRAS`, `permRAS`, and `obliqueRAS` from the primary onto the overlay — so the 3D raycaster sees both volumes in the exact same RAS frame regardless of source orientation.
- 🖼️ **Plots no longer disappear when the cursor leaves the canvas.** v0.5.4's `pointerup` listener called `nv.refreshDrawing(true)` against an empty draw bitmap on every plain navigation click, corrupting the GL state. Now gated behind a `drawingActive` flag that flips on only when the user explicitly enters Brush/Eraser mode.

## [0.5.4] — Brush colour palette · 3D-visible strokes

### Added
- 🎨 **6-colour brush palette** (red / green / blue / yellow / cyan / magenta). Replaces the manifest-driven label list, so the bundled threshold demo (one label) still gets a colour picker.
- 🖌️ **Brush strokes propagate to the 3D render** via `nv.refreshDrawing(true)` on canvas `pointerup`. Undo also refreshes so undone strokes vanish from the volumetric view.

## [0.5.3] — 3D mask alignment · working brush · responsive sidebar

### Fixed
- 🧭 **3D mask aligned with source vessels** via primary-`matRAS`-onto-overlay clone (NiiVue's 3D raycaster doesn't honour the NIfTI sform alone).
- 🖌️ **Brush + eraser actually paint** — switched from direct `nv.drawingEnabled = on` property writes to the public `setDrawingEnabled()` method which rebinds the pointer handlers (NiiVue 0.44.x quirk).
- 📐 **Sidebar rows responsive at narrow widths** — Opacity + Color stacks vertically, file-size pills stop pushing names off the right edge.

## [0.5.2] — Layout panel · DevTools · CSP for IPC

### Added
- 🖼️ **Layout panel** — switch between MPR + 3D / single-plane / 3D-only and four arrangements (Auto / Row / Col / 2×2). Plus toggles for orientation cube, colorbar, 3D crosshair, radiological convention.
- 🛠️ **Resizable + collapsible sidebar** with a drag handle (clamps 280–720 px, persists to localStorage).
- 🔬 **DevTools enabled in release builds** (`tauri = { features = ["devtools"] }`) — right-click → Inspect Element works in installed `.app`s.

### Fixed
- 🔌 **Auto-updater IPC unblocked** by adding `ipc://localhost` to CSP.
- 🪲 **Inference error toast captures `e.stack`** with a Copy button so users without DevTools can hand back full traces.

### v0.6.0 — Pathology mode (planned)
Whole-slide image viewer (OpenSeadragon + OME-TIFF / SVS / NDPI) with tile-based ONNX inference, public-domain WSI examples, and a pathology manifest schema. Same architectural commitments as Radiology (no upload, BYOM ONNX, signed updater). See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md#v060--pathology-mode) for phase breakdown.

### Fixed — README rendering issues
- 🐧 **Linux download button redesigned** — official Tux silhouette (simple-icons path), monochrome white on dark. No more cartoon face, no more yellow. All three buttons now share a consistent dark palette.
- 🧹 **Removed file extensions** from button labels (`macOS · .dmg` → `macOS`, etc.).
- 📊 **Static license + version badges** in the README header — fixes the "license: not specified" and "no releases or repo not found" red error states that appeared before the first release.
- 🖼️ **Placeholder `docs/assets/repo-visualization.svg` committed** so the README never shows a broken image, even before the first push to `main` triggers the visualizer workflow.
- 🪪 **`license`, `author`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `repository`** fields added to `package.json` so GitHub's repo-page sidebar shows "Apache-2.0" automatically, npm tooling resolves correctly, and links go to the right place.
- 📚 **From-zero new-machine setup guide** added at the top of [`docs/UPDATER.md`](docs/UPDATER.md) — every command spelled out, prerequisites table, web-UI vs `gh`-CLI options for adding GitHub secrets. README links to it directly.
- 🎨 **Hero banner refined** — bigger logo card with a crosshair pip, larger wordmark, second descriptive line, six tag pills (NO UPLOAD · WEBGPU · ONNX · PWA · DESKTOP · AUTO-UPDATE).

### Changed — README hub redesign
- 🎨 New **hero banner** ([`docs/assets/hero.svg`](docs/assets/hero.svg)) and **custom platform download buttons** ([`docs/assets/download-{macos,windows,linux}.svg`](docs/assets/)). No third-party hotlinks.
- 📊 **Stats badges row** (downloads / stars / forks / issues / contributors / license / latest release) via shields.io.
- 🗺️ **Live repo visualization**: [`.github/workflows/repo-visualizer.yml`](.github/workflows/repo-visualizer.yml) (githubocto/repo-visualizer / GitHub Next) regenerates `docs/assets/repo-visualization.svg` on every push to `main` and commits it back. Embedded in the README.
- 📈 **Star history graph** embedded via the api.star-history.com SVG endpoint.
- 📚 README slimmed down to a hub. Detailed deploy + updater content moved to [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) and [`docs/UPDATER.md`](docs/UPDATER.md).
- ✨ Compact 4×5 features grid, deploy options as a one-line-per-mode table.

## [0.2.0] — Auto-updater, theme toggle, release workflow

### Added — Tauri Sparkle-style updater
- 🔄 **Auto-update for desktop builds** via `tauri-plugin-updater`. Polls `https://github.com/ArioMoniri/semikap/releases/latest/download/latest.json` on launch and every 6 h; signed bundles install with one click and relaunch.
- 🔑 **`scripts/init-updater.mjs`** generates the Ed25519 signing keypair via `tauri signer generate`, embeds the public key in `tauri.conf.json`, and prints the two GitHub secrets to add (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`).
- ✂️ **`scripts/release.mjs`** cuts a release: bumps `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to a new semver, commits, tags `v<version>`, pushes (with `--no-push` and `--any-branch` opt-outs).
- 🤖 `tauri-release.yml` extended to consume the signing secrets and emit `includeUpdaterJson: true`, producing the `latest.json` manifest the client polls.
- 🆙 `UpdatePrompt` extended: in the Tauri shell it shows update version + notes and an **Install update** button; in the browser PWA the original SW-update flow is unchanged.

### Added — Phase 5 polish
- 🌗 **Light / Dark / System theme** with `class`-strategy Tailwind dark mode. Persisted in localStorage; tracks `prefers-color-scheme` when set to System. Three-state toggle in the header.
- 🧪 **TTA manifest field** — `tta.flips: { x?, y?, z? }` parsed and validated in the manifest schema (inference plumbing for the average comes in 0.3).
- 🚦 **`preferredEP` manifest field** (`auto` | `webgpu` | `webnn` | `wasm`) — when set, the inference worker tries that EP first and falls back through the rest of the chain.

### Bumped
- `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → **0.2.0**

### Added — DICOM-SEG, Tauri desktop, one-line installer, UX redesign

Clinical export:
- 🩻 **DICOM-SEG export** via dcmjs. Available when the source image is a DICOM file; produces a Segmentation IOD that references the source's StudyInstanceUID / SeriesInstanceUID / FrameOfReferenceUID and ships per-segment metadata derived from the model manifest (label name, recommended display CIELab from the manifest colours).
- 🧰 Source-format detection (`dicom` / `nifti` / `nrrd` / `mha` / `mgz` / `other`) baked into the volume record. Export buttons gate on it.

Desktop:
- 🖥️ **Tauri v2 wrapper** scaffolded under `src-tauri/`. Same Vite-built frontend, native window, no browser chrome. Strict CSP carried through.
- 🤖 **Desktop release workflow** (`.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml`) builds macOS-arm64, macOS-x64, Linux-x64, Windows-x64 installers on every `v*` tag and publishes a draft GitHub Release.
- 📥 README **download buttons** for the latest release.

Install + ops:
- 🚀 `install.sh` — one-line clone + install + build + start. Curl-pipe-able. Re-runs are idempotent.
- ❤️ `/healthz` JSON endpoint in the static server (returns `{status: "ok", uptime}`); Docker HEALTHCHECK and Helm liveness/readiness probes now point at it.

Frontend:
- 🎨 **Kaapana-style sidebar** with collapsible sections (Inputs / Model / Inference / Display / Correction / Export / Settings) via Radix Collapsible.
- 🆕 Polished gradient header with inline `<Logo>`, GitHub link, EP + version badges; better empty-state copy in the viewer.
- 🌡️ **WW/WL presets**: CT abdomen / lung / bone / brain / mediastinum / liver, plus an "auto" reset.

Build:
- ⌛ `dcmjs` declared as an opaque module via `src/types/dcmjs.d.ts` — no bundle bloat from `@types/*` packages.
- typecheck / lint / build all clean.

### Added — Cursor probe + .env config template

- 🎯 **Cursor probe**: top-right floating panel shows the voxel index, the physical mm position, and the sampled value at the crosshair as you move it. Listens to NiiVue's location-change callback.
- 🧾 **`.env.example`** with `PORT` / `HOST` / `NODE_ENV`. Optional — every value still has a sensible default and the app boots without it. README documents it explicitly.

### Added — Performance + correction-export polish

- 📦 **Bundle slim-down**: WASM (the 25 MB ORT bundle) is no longer precached; it now downloads on demand on first inference. Cold install drops from ~28 MB to ~3 MB; if WebGPU services every run on the user's machine, WASM is never fetched at all.
- 💾 **Save corrected mask**: a third "Save corrected" button writes a NIfTI that combines the AI mask with the brush corrections. Eraser strokes propagate as 0; brush strokes override the AI label.
- ♿ **A11y**: skip-link to the viewer (visible on focus), `aria-label="Image viewer"` and `tabIndex={-1}` on the viewer section so the skip target receives focus.

### Added — Phase 2 / 3 / 4 polish

- 🩻 **Multi-series overlay**: SecondarySeriesPicker loads a second image as a coloured overlay (e.g. PET on CT, T2 on T1), with opacity + colormap controls. Safely resets when a new primary is loaded.
- ⛑️ **ErrorBoundary** wraps the app — synchronous render errors get a recoverable fallback, are logged to the OPFS audit, and never crash the page.
- 🔔 **Service-worker update prompt**: in-page toast when a new build is available; one-click "Reload" activates it. Also surfaces the "ready for offline use" toast on first install. Periodic update check (60 min cadence).
- ☸️ **Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/tamias`): Deployment + Service + optional Ingress + optional HPA. Non-root pod, read-only root FS, dropped capabilities. README and values.yaml call out the COOP/COEP-preservation requirement for the ingress controller.
- 📣 **README "no manual edits required" banner** at the top, plus a Configuration table covering every override (`PORT`, `HOST`, Helm image, ingress host, replicas, HPA).

### Added — Phase 2 / 3 increment

- 🌫️ **Gaussian-weighted sliding-window blending** — eliminates seams at tile boundaries (matches MONAI's default σ = patch/8)
- ⚡ **WebNN execution provider** added to the fallback chain (WebGPU → WebNN → WASM); UI surfaces both the resolved EP and the providers attempted
- 🗂️ **OPFS warm-cache wired into the model picker** — cached models list, one-click reload, hash-verify on retrieval, delete-from-cache
- 🎚️ **Display controls panel** — window centre / width sliders, mask opacity + colormap (red / green / blue / roi_i256)
- 🖌️ **Brush + eraser correction** via NiiVue's draw layer; per-label palette derived from the manifest, undo, auto-disable when no result
- 🧾 **Reproducibility bundle export** (JSON, schema `tamias.repro.v1`) — input file SHA-256, model SHA-256 + manifest, resolved provider chain, per-label volumes (mL), timing, app version
- 📒 **Local audit log in OPFS** — append-only NDJSON of every app-start, model-cache, inference, export, and error event; export + clear from a Settings panel
- 🩻 **Study metadata strip** floating over the viewer (file name, dims, spacing, dtype)
- 📐 **Volumetrics**: per-label voxel count + volume in mL, with a clearly-labelled voxel-perimeter surface-area approximation
- 🪪 App-version badge in the header (sourced from `package.json` via Vite `define`)

### Added — Phase 1 foundation

- 🐿️ **Project scaffold**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript (strict), Tailwind, ESLint flat config, Prettier
- 🛡️ **Privacy posture**: strict in-page CSP (no network egress), COOP/COEP enforcement (server + `coi-serviceworker` shim)
- 🌐 **PWA**: installable manifest, service-worker precache via `vite-plugin-pwa`, offline-first
- 📂 **Local file ingestion**: File System Access API on Chromium with drag-and-drop fallback
- 🖼️ **Viewer**: NiiVue wrapper supporting DICOM, NIfTI, NRRD, MetaImage, MGZ; multi-planar + 3D
- 🧠 **Inference**: `onnxruntime-web` with WebGPU EP and multi-threaded WASM-SIMD fallback, in a dedicated worker
- 🧱 **Sliding-window 3D inference** with per-tile accumulation and per-voxel argmax
- 📋 **Strict model manifest** schema + parser, optional SHA-256 verification
- 💽 **OPFS model cache** keyed by SHA-256
- 💾 **NIfTI-1 mask export** to local disk via FSA save dialog (with download fallback)
- 🔎 **GPU diagnostics**: surfaces vendor / architecture / device for the active WebGPU adapter, or WASM thread count
- 🎨 **shadcn-style UI**: Radix primitives + lucide-react icons + cva + tailwind-merge — Button, Card, Badge, Progress, Separator
- 🚀 **Static server** (`scripts/serve.mjs`): Node-only, sets COOP/COEP, picks default port `5180`, walks up if busy, prints `TAMIAS_PORT=<port>` to stdout for systemd / Docker / pm2
- 🐳 **Dockerfile + docker-compose** (multi-stage, non-root runtime user)
- 🤖 **GitHub Actions CI**: typecheck → lint → build → upload `dist/` artifact
