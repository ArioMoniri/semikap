## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.3] — Cross-origin isolation on macOS Tauri + Angle/W-L coexistence

### Fixed — Critical UX regressions

- 🧵 **`crossOriginIsolated === false` on the macOS Tauri build.** v0.7.0/0.7.1/0.7.2 set `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` via `app.security.headers` so the WKWebView wouldn't block the Tauri custom protocol or HuggingFace fetches. But Safari/WKWebView **does not honour the `credentialless` value** the way Chromium does — `self.crossOriginIsolated` stayed `false`, `SharedArrayBuffer` was unavailable, and ONNX inference ran in single-threaded WASM mode (the WebGPU backend works either way; the regression is the WASM fallback path). Switched headers back to `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` AND removed the v0.7.2 "skip on tauri://" guard in `public/coi-config.js`, so `coi-serviceworker` now installs on the desktop app too. The SW intercepts every fetch and adds `CORP: cross-origin` to HuggingFace responses, which lets `require-corp` accept them. Net effect on macOS Tauri: `crossOriginIsolated === true`, multi-threaded WASM unlocked, HF downloads still work.
- 📐 **Angle button broke right-mouse-drag W/L.** Toggling the Angle tool in v0.7.1/0.7.2 forced NiiVue's `dragMode` to `'none'`, but `'none'` also disables NiiVue's right-mouse-drag W/L. Result: the user could not adjust window/level while measuring an angle. Removed the forced `setDragMode('none')` in `ToolsPanel.toggleAngle`. Kept the angle-vertex capture intact by tightening the `pointerup` filter in `Viewer.tsx` to `e.button === 0` only — left-clicks still drop angle vertices, but right-mouse drags pass straight through to NiiVue's W/L handler.
- 🖱️ **Stray angle vertices from right-clicks.** Same root cause: the v0.7.1 pointerup handler ignored `e.button`, so a right-mouse-up at the end of a W/L drag also dropped a third (unwanted) angle point. Now filtered to button 0.

### Why `require-corp` works in v0.7.3 (and didn't in v0.6.x)

The original argument against `require-corp` was that it blocks the Tauri custom-protocol IPC bridge and HuggingFace fetches. Both turn out to be solvable:
- Tauri custom-protocol responses are **same-origin** with the document, so they don't need a `CORP` header for `require-corp` to admit them.
- HuggingFace responses are cross-origin and don't carry `CORP`. The fix is to register `coi-serviceworker` on the `tauri://` scheme too, which we used to skip. The SW intercepts the response and adds `CORP: cross-origin`, which `require-corp` accepts.

`coi-serviceworker` already wraps `register()` in its own try/catch, so on Tauri builds where SW registration genuinely fails (older WKWebView, no SW support compiled in) the app silently falls back to the v0.7.2 single-threaded path — strictly an upgrade from v0.7.2.

## [0.7.2] — SAM URL fixes + BYO inline form + CSP-safe SW guard

### Fixed — Critical SAM-onboarding regressions

- 🔗 **SAM model 401/404 download failures.** All three preset URLs were broken: `onnx-community/sam2-hiera-tiny/resolve/main/onnx/encoder.onnx` 404'd (the file is named `vision_encoder.onnx` in that repo and the repo itself is older than the ONNX export); `sam2-hiera-base-plus` was a typo for the canonical `sam2.1-hiera-base-plus-ONNX`; `Xenova/medsam` 401'd because the org rotated the repo to `Xenova/medsam-vit-base`. Updated `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` to point at the working `onnx-community/sam2.1-hiera-{tiny,base-plus}-ONNX` repos with the actual `vision_encoder_quantized.onnx` + `prompt_encoder_mask_decoder_quantized.onnx` filenames. Verified each endpoint returns HTTP 200 before tagging.
- 📝 **"SAM 3 (BYO URL)" + "Custom URL…" buttons did nothing.** Both flows used three sequential `window.prompt()` calls to collect name + encoder URL + decoder URL. macOS Tauri (WKWebView) silently blocks `prompt()`, so the dialog never appeared and the buttons looked dead. Replaced with an in-card inline form (`name`, `encoder URL`, `decoder URL` inputs + Submit/Cancel) in both `SamPanel` and `PathologySamPanel`. The form lives inside the SAM card so the user never leaves the panel; Submit runs the same `loadSamModel` pipeline as a preset.
- 🪪 **"SAM 3 (bring-your-own URL)" label overflowed its outline button.** Renamed to "SAM 3 (BYO URL)" so the chip stays inside the button outline at the panel's narrow width.
- 🛡️ **CSP-blocked inline COI guard.** v0.7.0 added an inline `<script>` to skip `coi-serviceworker` registration under the Tauri `tauri://` protocol — but the strict CSP (`script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, no `'unsafe-inline'`) blocked it on every load. Externalised the guard to `public/coi-config.js` so the same logic runs without a CSP exception. SW registration is still skipped on `tauri://` (where headers are set natively) and runs on `http://`/`https://` (where the SW provides COOP+COEP).

### Internal

- Both `SamPanel` and `PathologySamPanel` now share a small `CustomUrlForm` subcomponent shape (3 inputs + 2 buttons). `PathologySamPanel` previously had no Custom URL flow at all — the BYO preset used to call `loadSamModel` against a `null` URL and fail silently; it now routes the same way the radiology panel does.

## [0.7.1] — Global undo stack + Angle measurement tool

### Added — Centralised undo for tools + settings
- ⌨️ **Global Cmd-Z / Ctrl-Z** now undoes any reversible UI mutation (slider releases, mode switches), not just brush strokes. Cross-OS via `e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey`. Brush undo stays separate (NiiVue's draw-history `drawUndo()`); the two handlers don't collide because the brush handler only attaches when brush/eraser/smart mode is active.
- 🧰 New `undoStack: UndoEntry[]` slice on the zustand store with `pushUndo({label, revert})` + `popUndo()`. `revert()` is closure-captured at push time — no inverse-delta bookkeeping needed for coarse-grained UI mutations. Cap at 50 entries; oldest dropped silently.
- 🪪 Producers wired in v0.7.1: **mask opacity slider** (one undo per pointer-down → pointer-up drag, gated so per-mousemove ticks don't pollute the stack) and **mask colormap selector**. More producers (W/L sliders, layout mode switches, drag-mode changes, distance ruler clear) follow in subsequent v0.7.x patches as the same pattern is applied to each panel.

### Added — Angle measurement tool (3-click, mm-space)
- 📐 New **Angle** button in the radiology Tools panel. Click vertex → first arm endpoint → second arm endpoint. Status pill walks through each click (`Click on a 2D slice to set the vertex.` → `Click to set the first arm endpoint.` → `Angle: 67.3° · vertex (12.4, 34.7, 56.0) mm`).
- 🧮 NiivueViewer wrapper gains `setAngleMode(on)`, `addAnglePoint(mm)`, `clearAnglePoints()`, `onAngleUpdate(cb)` and `AngleState` type. Vectors computed in mm-space (physical real-world coords, not voxel grid) so the angle is independent of slice spacing or anisotropy. Formula: `acos((a₁·a₂) / (|a₁|·|a₂|))` clamped to `[-1, 1]` to avoid floating-point NaNs at colinear points.
- 🖱️ Click capture piggybacks on the existing pointerup listener in Viewer.tsx + a probe-stream cache of the latest mm coordinate. Drag mode auto-flips to `'none'` while in angle mode so click+drag doesn't also pan/contrast.
- 🧹 Reset clears captured points but stays in angle mode. Toggling Angle off clears state entirely.



### Fixed — v0.7.0 polish (caught during pre-publish smoke-test)

- 🛑 **`npm ci` lockfile drift unblocked.** First v0.7.0 build (commit `e62a1f7a`) failed on all four platforms with `lock file's source-map@0.7.0 does not satisfy source-map@0.6.1`. Regenerated `package-lock.json` via `npm install --package-lock-only` — six-line diff (added the nested `source-map@0.6.1` resolution that `source-map-support` requires). v0.7.0 re-cut on a clean lockfile.
- 🌗 **Dark-mode button contrast.** `outline` + `ghost` variants in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` had zero `dark:` overrides — unselected Tools/Layout buttons rendered as "barely-visible white card" against the dark slate panels. Added explicit `dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 dark:border-slate-600`. `ink` variant gets a matching `dark:bg-slate-700`. Every state stays legible at every contrast level.
- 🛡️ **Defensive WebGL recovery in the Viewer.** Three new event listeners in `src/components/Viewer.tsx`: `webglcontextlost` (with `preventDefault()` so the browser treats the loss as recoverable rather than permanent — Tauri WKWebView evicts contexts under memory pressure when CT + 3D + concurrent SAM encoder are active), `webglcontextrestored` → `redraw()`, and `pointerleave` → deferred `redraw()` (defends against the v0.5.4-family cursor-leave-blanks-canvas bug for tool / context-menu cases that bypass the brush-only `refreshDrawing` gate from v0.5.5). `NiivueViewer.redraw()` is the new public unconditional re-paint method.
- 🔌 **Multi-threaded WASM in the desktop WebView.** Added `app.security.headers` block to `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` + `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`. The browser PWA already gets these from `scripts/serve.mjs` (and from `coi-serviceworker` as a fallback on hosts that strip them); the Tauri custom protocol bypassed the static server, so the WebView ran without `crossOriginIsolated`, falling back to single-threaded WASM. With the headers in place `self.crossOriginIsolated === true` in both modes and inference uses up to 8 threads.
- 🔔 **Updater banner no longer leaks raw markdown.** `UpdatePrompt.tsx` previously rendered `latest.json.notes` with `whitespace-pre-wrap`, so the user saw `## 🐿️ TAMIAS v0.5.7` literally, mid-word truncation, and stray table pipes. Strip headings / table rows / bullets / raw HTML, join with `·`, hard-cap at 280 chars, full markdown still available on the title tooltip.
- 🪪 **Stale modality-toggle tooltip** — "preview, full release in v0.6.0" → "OpenSeadragon + OME-TIFF / SVS / NDPI + tile-based ONNX inference" (the actually-shipped feature description).


> First release with click + box + text prompted segmentation, in **both** Radiology and Pathology modes. Architecture is identical across modes: one shared `src/lib/sam/` infrastructure (manifest, loader, OPFS cache, session wrappers) plus one shared `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` that branches on `inputMode: 'gray' | 'rgb'` to pick the radiology (auto-window grayscale) vs pathology (RGB) preprocessor. No upload, weights cached in OPFS, SAM 3 ONNX URL slot ready for when a stable export ships. **CSP widened to allow `huggingface.co` + `*.huggingface.co` + `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co`** for opt-in weight download — every fetch is user-triggered, nothing fires automatically.

### Added — SAM (Segment Anything) for Radiology AND Pathology

**Phase A — Scaffolding**:
- 🧠 `src/lib/sam/` — `SamManifest` schema, prompt types (point / box / text), `SamMaskResult`, OPFS cache, worker envelopes.
- 🗂️ `docs/SAM.md` — full plan: HuggingFace ONNX exports table (SAM 2 Tiny / Base+ / MedSAM, SAM 3 stub), encoder-once + decoder-per-prompt architecture.

**Phase B — Runtime ONNX wiring (Radiology)**:
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/preprocess.ts` — slice auto-window → 1024² ImageNet-normalised tensor.
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/postprocess.ts` — bilinear up-sample + threshold + best-IoU pick.
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/loader.ts` — streaming HuggingFace fetch with progress, sha256, OPFS.
- ⚙️ `src/lib/sam/session.ts` — encoder + decoder ort wrappers, WebGPU → WebNN → WASM fallback, prompt-tensor packer.
- ⚙️ `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` — Comlink `encode()` + `decode()` + `reset()`; module-scope session cache.
- 🩻 `src/components/SamPanel.tsx` + `SamPromptOverlay.tsx` + `niivue.ts` helpers — full UI flow: click-capture → encode → prompts → generate → preview with IoU → commit through existing `addMaskOverlay` (inherits the v0.5.5 RAS-alignment fix).

**Phase B' — SAM-on-Pathology (NEW)**:
- 🪄 `src/lib/sam/preprocess-rgb.ts` — RGB preprocessing (no auto-window; resize + ImageNet-normalise + HWC→CHW). Used by pathology where slides are already RGB.
- 🩻 `src/components/PathologySamPanel.tsx` + `PathologySamOverlay.tsx` — pathology variant: pick ROI on the slide → read a 1024² tile from level-0 → encode → prompts in level-0 pixel coords → mask committed via `setMaskOverlay`.
- 🩻 `src/components/pathology/PathologyViewer.tsx` — `PathologyViewerHandle` extended with `readLevel0Region` + `canvasToLevel0` for SAM ROI scoping.
- 🩻 `src/lib/pathology/osd-viewer.ts` — `readLevel0Region(x, y, w, h, targetW, targetH)` proxies to the underlying `TileLoader`.
- ⚙️ `src/workers/sam.worker.ts` — `encode()` extended with `inputMode: 'gray' | 'rgb'` discriminator that picks the correct preprocessor. Decoder unchanged.
- 🩻 `src/components/pathology/PathologyShell.tsx` — new "SAM (assisted)" sidebar section between Inference and Tools.
- 🧠 `store.ts` — separate `samPathology` slice mirrors `sam` so the two viewers stay independent (loading SAM in one doesn't auto-load it in the other).

**Phase C.1 — Smart brush handoff** (radiology):
- 🪄 `AnnotationPanel.tsx` points users at the SAM panel for click-to-mask assisted segmentation.

**Phase C.2 — Single-stroke smart-brush** (radiology):
- 🪄 New **Smart** mode in `AnnotationPanel.tsx` alongside Brush/Eraser. One click on a 2D slice → SAM encode + decode with that single positive point → mask committed straight into the brush layer at the active label, no Encode/Generate/Commit buttons.
- 🪛 Capture happens at the document level in capture-phase so NiiVue's own draw handlers don't fire; drawing is also explicitly disabled while in smart mode to prevent stray voxel-paints during slow encodes.
- 🔒 The Smart button is disabled until a SAM model is loaded; tip box adapts copy depending on whether SAM is offline.
- 🎯 Reuses `addMaskOverlay()` so the mask inherits the v0.5.5 RAS-alignment fix in 2D + 3D.

**Phase D — Cross-slice mask propagation** (radiology):
- 🧭 SamPanel preview block gains **±5 slices** and **±15 slices** propagate buttons that walk neighbour slices (interleaved ±1, ±2, …, ±N), re-encode each, and decode using the previous slice's mask bbox as a box prompt.
- 🛠️ `src/lib/viewer/niivue.ts` + `src/components/Viewer.tsx` expose `getAxialSliceAt(z)` so the propagator can pull arbitrary slices without scrolling the user's crosshair.
- 🩹 Bbox is re-tightened from each new mask each iteration; propagation stops early when a slice produces an empty mask. Multi-slice mask is committed via a single `addMaskOverlay` call.
- ⚖️ Intentionally simpler than SAM 2's video tracker — works with any backbone, single decode call per slice.

**Phase E — Auto-save folder for screenshots**:
- 📸 `pickDirectory` + `saveBytesToDirectory` in `src/lib/fs/filesystem.ts`. Settings panel folder picker. ToolsPanel writes straight there when `prefs.screenshotMode === 'auto'`.

**Phase E.2 — IndexedDB-backed handle persistence**:
- 💾 New `src/lib/fs/idb-handle.ts` — `readStoredHandle` / `writeStoredHandle` / `deleteStoredHandle` / `requestHandlePermission` over a small `idb`-style direct-request API (no extra dep). DB `tamias-prefs`, store `handles`, version 1.
- ⚙️ `SettingsPanel.tsx` writes the handle on Pick and exposes a **Forget** button that deletes both IDB and in-memory copies.
- 🚀 `store.ts` rehydrates the handle on app boot, queries+requests `readwrite` permission, silently falls back if either step fails (e.g. user revoked access in browser settings).

**Phase F — SAM 3 placeholder + Custom URL onboarding**:
- 🪪 New 4th preset entry `sam3-byo` in `loader.ts`; `family: 'sam3'`, supports `['point', 'box', 'text']`, both encoder/decoder URLs `null` (BYO).
- 🧪 New `buildCustomSamManifest({ name, encoderUrl, decoderUrl, family?, expectsText? })` synthesises a manifest at runtime.
- 🪄 SamPanel onboarding routes the SAM 3 preset through a Custom URL flow (prompts for name + encoder URL + decoder URL); a dedicated **Custom URL…** button at the bottom of the onboarding view supports any other ONNX export.
- 🌉 Bridge for SAM 3 once Meta publishes a stable ONNX export — no app rebuild required.

### Changed — CSP for opt-in SAM weight download
- 🔌 `connect-src` adds `huggingface.co` + `*.huggingface.co` + `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co`. **Always user-triggered**; nothing fetches automatically.

### Notes
- Branch `feat/sam-radiology` merged to `main` via PR #3 (commit `2b011088`). Branch retained for history.
- All planned phases (A, B, B′, C.1, C.2, D, E, E.2, F) shipped. Out of scope for v0.7.0: 3D-native SAM (SAM-Med3D / MedSAM-3D) — deferred to a later v0.7.x patch; SAM 2 video-tracker temporal embeddings — superseded for now by Phase D's bbox-carry-forward propagator.
- Model licensing: TAMIAS does not bundle SAM weights. Users either bring their own ONNX export or trigger the one-click HuggingFace download. **Meta's SAM 2 weights are released under Apache 2.0; MedSAM weights are released under Apache 2.0**; see `docs/SAM.md` for the full HuggingFace export table and per-checkpoint license confirmation.

## [0.6.1] — One-click pathology examples + bundled tissue-mask ONNX

### Added
- 🧪 New `Examples` section in the Pathology sidebar (between Slide and Model). One-click **Download** + **Load into app** mirrors the radiology example kit — no file picker, no manual download.
- 🧠 `examples/pathology/tissue_mask.onnx` (448 B, hand-built, opset 17, validated by `onnx.checker`). Architecture: `image[1,3,h,w] → ReduceMean → Sub → Mul → Concat → seg[1,2,h,w]` — argmax across class dim returns 1 for pixels darker than the imagenet mean (= H&E-stained tissue). CC0.
- 🧰 `src/lib/fs/pathology-examples.ts` — OPFS-backed loader mirroring `src/lib/fs/examples.ts`, dedicated OPFS root (`tamias-pathology-examples`).
- 🧰 `src/components/pathology/PathologyExamplesPanel.tsx` — Download / Cached / Load-into-app / Remove-all buttons.

## [0.6.0] — Pathology mode (Phase A + B + C)

### Added — Pathology mode replaces the v0.5.7 placeholder
- 🔬 **OpenSeadragon-based whole-slide viewer** with a custom in-memory
  tile bridge. Tiles never touch the network — the bridge intercepts
  OSD's `downloadTileStart` and serves canvases painted from the loaded
  tile loader's RGBA bytes. Ships a 2-D navigator inset (bottom-right),
  pan / zoom / fit / 1:1 controls, and a screenshot composer that
  combines the OSD draw canvas with our overlay canvas.
- 🧬 **OME-TIFF loader** (`geotiff.js`). Walks the IFD list, identifies
  the pyramid chain by monotonic-decreasing area, parses OME-XML
  `PhysicalSizeX/Y` for MPP (with µm / nm / mm / cm unit handling), and
  exposes `readTile` + `readRegion` — the latter automatically picks the
  closest pyramid level for the requested downsample, then resamples to
  target size via canvas bilinear.
- 🧬 **Aperio SVS + Hamamatsu NDPI direct loading** through the same
  pyramidal-TIFF path. Vendor MPP is recovered from:
  - the Aperio `MPP = 0.25` token in `ImageDescription` for SVS, and
  - TIFF `XResolution` / `YResolution` + `ResolutionUnit` for NDPI
    (and any other plain pyramidal TIFF that exposes resolution tags).
  Slides that hit a vendor extension `geotiff.js` can't decode (NDPI
  > 4 GB with `NDP_OFFSET_HIGH`, JPEG2000-encoded SVS) fall through to
  a clear error dialog with the `bioformats2raw + raw2ometiff` recipe
  pre-filled. No OpenSlide-WASM binary is shipped — every byte is
  decoded by a pure-JS / WASM TIFF reader so there's no native binary
  to sign or audit.
- 🧬 **Single-file fallback** (PNG / JPEG / non-pyramidal TIFF). Decodes
  once into an `OffscreenCanvas` (or `HTMLCanvasElement` on older
  browsers), then services tile reads via `getImageData`. Capped by
  the browser's canvas size limit (~16 384 px / axis).
- 📏 **Distance ruler in microns**. Switches OSD into a non-panning
  mode, draws an amber ruler with end caps, and labels the mid-line in
  µm (or mm, when the measurement is ≥ 1 mm). Falls back to pixels when
  the slide has no MPP metadata.
- 🛠️ **Pathology Tools panel** (Pan / Distance / Zoom +/− / Fit / 1:1 /
  Reset / Screenshot). Same idiom as the radiology toolbar.
- 🧠 **Tile-based ONNX inference worker** with strict pathology
  manifest validation. Walks the ROI in `patch × stride` steps, requests
  patches at the manifest's MPP via `readRegion`, runs ONNX, and stitches
  results by output kind:
  - `segmentation` → per-pixel argmax into a label map (last-write-wins
    in overlap regions; Gaussian soft-blending tracked as follow-up).
  - `classification` → one (label, score) per patch + label-painted
    heatmap so the overlay renders consistently across output kinds.
  - `heatmap` → per-pixel score (×255) accumulated and averaged across
    overlapping patches.
  - `detection` → list of (x, y, label, score) records per patch.
- 📋 **Pathology manifest schema** (`mpp`, `patch`, `stride`,
  `channelOrder`, `normalization`, `output.type`, `output.labels`,
  `output.colors`, `preferredEP`, `sha256`). Validated strictly with the
  same idiom as the radiology manifest parser; the first malformed
  field fails loudly.
- 📤 **Result PNG + sidecar JSON export**. PNG renders the result
  buffer through the manifest's colour table (matching the on-screen
  overlay). JSON sidecar records slide name, model name + SHA-256, MPP,
  ROI, output kind, ONNX provider, attempted providers, and wall-clock
  duration. Carries the standard "Research Use Only" stamp.
- 📜 **OPFS audit log entry per pathology run** (`kind: 'inference'`)
  with the same fields the radiology side already records.

### Added — Modality toggle is now functional
- 🔬 The header **Pathology** toggle now mounts the full pathology
  shell (sidebar + viewer) instead of the v0.5.7 placeholder card.
  Switching modes preserves the sidebar's collapsed state and width.

### Added — Examples + docs
- 🧪 `examples/pathology/README.md` — pointers to public-domain WSIs
  (CAMELYON16, PANDA, TCGA, HuBMAP) with conversion recipes for SVS /
  NDPI via `bioformats2raw + raw2ometiff` or QuPath.
- 📋 `examples/pathology/tissue_mask.json` — reference manifest
  exercising every schema field.
- 📚 `docs/PATHOLOGY.md` — full pathology mode documentation
  (capabilities, limits, manifest reference, inference pipeline).

### Added — Slide brush + eraser (Phase B)
- 🎚️ **Six-colour brush + eraser** on the slide overlay, mirroring the
  radiology brush palette (red / green / blue / yellow / cyan / magenta).
  Strokes paint into a per-slide buffer capped at 4 096 × 4 096 (the
  slide's bounding rectangle, mapped 1:1 to that resolution) so paint
  stays memory-bounded even on 100 k × 100 k slides.
- ↶ **Per-stroke undo** (16-deep stack) and **Clear all**.
- 🎨 **Brush radius slider** (1 – 256 slide-level-0 pixels).
- 📤 **"Save brush colours" export** writes one transparent-background
  PNG per painted colour (`__brush_red.png`, `__brush_green.png`, …)
  via the same File System Access API path as the rest of the
  pathology export panel.

### Added — Phase C polish
- 🧪 **Bundled synthetic H&E sample** (`examples/pathology/synthetic_he_512.png`,
  ~ 212 KiB). Procedurally generated by `scripts/build-pathology-sample.mjs`
  (CC0, no real patient data) so users can exercise the viewer + brush
  + tile inference pipeline end-to-end without downloading a real WSI
  first. Sidecar `synthetic_he_512.json` declares 0.5 µm/px (20× scan
  equivalent) for the distance ruler.
- 🩻 **Hero banner refresh** covers both modalities — the strapline now
  mentions OME-TIFF / SVS / NDPI alongside DICOM / NIfTI / NRRD, and a
  green PATHOLOGY pill joins the badge row.

### Deferred to a follow-up release
- 🌡️ Gaussian soft-blending of overlapping segmentation patches
  (currently last-write-wins).

### Dependencies
- ➕ `openseadragon` 6.x for the pyramidal viewer.
- ➕ `geotiff` 3.x for OME-TIFF / TIFF decoding.

## [0.5.7] — Radiology polish · Modality toggle · v0.6.0 groundwork

### Added — Radiology toolbar polish
- 🔍 **Zoom in / out** buttons in the Tools panel (1.25× / 0.8×, clamped 0.25–16). Wraps NiiVue `scene.volScaleMultiplier`.
- 📸 **Screenshot button** captures the current canvas (overlay + crosshair + 3D composited) as a PNG via `canvas.toBlob` + the existing FSA save path.
- 🔎 **Cached-models search bar** in the Model picker — appears once you have 5+ cached models and filters case-insensitively across name, version, modality.

### Added — Modality toggle (Pathology placeholder)
- 🔬 **Modality segmented control** in the header (Radiology · Pathology). Pathology renders a placeholder card with a roadmap link — the full implementation lands in v0.6.0. The toggle exists in v0.5.7 so the pathology track is discoverable and roadmappable from inside the app.

### Fixed — Workflow pattern matching
- 🛠️ **`alias-assets` is now productName-agnostic.** v0.5.6 broke when `productName` changed from `TAMIAS` to `Tamias`: tauri-action started writing files like `Tamias_0.5.6_aarch64.dmg`, but the workflow had `TAMIAS_*` patterns hardcoded, so the alias mirror + `latest.json` reassembly silently no-op'd, leaving 21 assets and an empty `latest.json`. The patterns now use a generic capture group (`*_*`) and the `latest.json` step derives the prefix dynamically from the discovered `.sig` files.
- 🚫 **v0.5.6 release reverted to draft** so installed users don't auto-update to a release with a broken `latest.json`. v0.5.5 stays as `releases/latest`. v0.5.7 supersedes both.

## [0.5.6] — Radiology toolbar · sidebar preview · brush-per-colour · icon polish

### Added — Tools panel
- 🛠️ **New "Tools" sidebar section** — drag-mode toolbar (Default / W-L / Pan / Distance) wired to NiiVue's `DRAG_MODE`. Distance ruler shows mm read-out at the cursor.
- 🩻 **Outline toggle** for the AI mask — re-renders the mask as a 1-voxel-thick boundary instead of a solid fill, so anatomy underneath stays visible. Reversible client-side (no inference re-run).
- ↺ **Reset** — zoom 1.0, crosshair to centre, default W/L.

### Added — Sidebar volume preview
- 🩻 **Mid-axial-slice thumbnail** under the loaded volume name (LocalFilePicker). Auto-windows on the slice's 1st/99th percentiles so dark CTs and bright MRs both render legibly. ~10 ms render, no GL.

### Added — Brush per-colour export
- 🎨 **"Save brush colours" button** in Export — splits the drawn bitmap by label index and writes one binary `.nii` per painted colour (`__brush_red.nii`, `__brush_green.nii`, …). Each colour becomes a standalone mask suitable for ITK-SNAP / training-label workflows.

### Changed — App identity
- 🍎 **Icon padding** matches Apple's app-icon template (~10% transparent inset on each edge of the 1024² frame). The squirrel no longer looks visibly larger than every other app in the macOS Dock.
- 🪪 **`productName` "Tamias"** (title case) — the macOS bundle's `CFBundleDisplayName` now reads "Tamias" in Dock hover, Finder, and the menu bar app name. (Note: this rename is what triggered the v0.5.6 alias-assets regression — fixed in v0.5.7.)

## [0.5.5] — General-model 3D alignment · cursor-leave blanking fix

### Fixed
- 🧭 **3D mask alignment now works on arbitrary source NIfTIs.** The v0.5.3 `matRAS` clone fixed axis-aligned volumes but still drifted on LPI MRs and oblique CTs. v0.5.5 also clones `dimsRAS`, `pixDimsRAS`, `permRAS`, and `obliqueRAS` from the primary onto the overlay — so the 3D raycaster sees both volumes in the exact same RAS frame regardless of source orientation.
- 🖼️ **Plots no longer disappear when the cursor leaves the canvas.** v0.5.4's `pointerup` listener called `nv.refreshDrawing(true)` against an empty draw bitmap on every plain navigation click, corrupting the GL state. Now gated behind a `drawingActive` flag that flips on only when the user explicitly enters Brush/Eraser mode.

## [0.5.4] — Brush colour palette · 3D-visible strokes

### Added
- 🎨 **6-colour brush palette** (red / green / blue / yellow / cyan / magenta). Replaces the manifest-driven label list, so the bundled threshold demo (one label) still gets a colour picker.
- 🖌️ **Brush strokes propagate to the 3D render** via `nv.refreshDrawing(true)` on canvas `pointerup`. Undo also refreshes so undone strokes vanish from the volumetric view.

## [0.5.3] — 3D mask alignment · working brush · responsive sidebar

### Fixed
- 🧭 **3D mask aligned with source vessels** via primary-`matRAS`-onto-overlay clone (NiiVue's 3D raycaster doesn't honour the NIfTI sform alone).
- 🖌️ **Brush + eraser actually paint** — switched from direct `nv.drawingEnabled = on` property writes to the public `setDrawingEnabled()` method which rebinds the pointer handlers (NiiVue 0.44.x quirk).
- 📐 **Sidebar rows responsive at narrow widths** — Opacity + Color stacks vertically, file-size pills stop pushing names off the right edge.

## [0.5.2] — Layout panel · DevTools · CSP for IPC

### Added
- 🖼️ **Layout panel** — switch between MPR + 3D / single-plane / 3D-only and four arrangements (Auto / Row / Col / 2×2). Plus toggles for orientation cube, colorbar, 3D crosshair, radiological convention.
- 🛠️ **Resizable + collapsible sidebar** with a drag handle (clamps 280–720 px, persists to localStorage).
- 🔬 **DevTools enabled in release builds** (`tauri = { features = ["devtools"] }`) — right-click → Inspect Element works in installed `.app`s.

### Fixed
- 🔌 **Auto-updater IPC unblocked** by adding `ipc://localhost` to CSP.
- 🪲 **Inference error toast captures `e.stack`** with a Copy button so users without DevTools can hand back full traces.

### v0.6.0 — Pathology mode (planned)
Whole-slide image viewer (OpenSeadragon + OME-TIFF / SVS / NDPI) with tile-based ONNX inference, public-domain WSI examples, and a pathology manifest schema. Same architectural commitments as Radiology (no upload, BYOM ONNX, signed updater). See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md#v060--pathology-mode) for phase breakdown.

### Fixed — README rendering issues
- 🐧 **Linux download button redesigned** — official Tux silhouette (simple-icons path), monochrome white on dark. No more cartoon face, no more yellow. All three buttons now share a consistent dark palette.
- 🧹 **Removed file extensions** from button labels (`macOS · .dmg` → `macOS`, etc.).
- 📊 **Static license + version badges** in the README header — fixes the "license: not specified" and "no releases or repo not found" red error states that appeared before the first release.
- 🖼️ **Placeholder `docs/assets/repo-visualization.svg` committed** so the README never shows a broken image, even before the first push to `main` triggers the visualizer workflow.
- 🪪 **`license`, `author`, `homepage`, `bugs`, `repository`** fields added to `package.json` so GitHub's repo-page sidebar shows "Apache-2.0" automatically, npm tooling resolves correctly, and links go to the right place.
- 📚 **From-zero new-machine setup guide** added at the top of [`docs/UPDATER.md`](docs/UPDATER.md) — every command spelled out, prerequisites table, web-UI vs `gh`-CLI options for adding GitHub secrets. README links to it directly.
- 🎨 **Hero banner refined** — bigger logo card with a crosshair pip, larger wordmark, second descriptive line, six tag pills (NO UPLOAD · WEBGPU · ONNX · PWA · DESKTOP · AUTO-UPDATE).

### Changed — README hub redesign
- 🎨 New **hero banner** ([`docs/assets/hero.svg`](docs/assets/hero.svg)) and **custom platform download buttons** ([`docs/assets/download-{macos,windows,linux}.svg`](docs/assets/)). No third-party hotlinks.
- 📊 **Stats badges row** (downloads / stars / forks / issues / contributors / license / latest release) via shields.io.
- 🗺️ **Live repo visualization**: [`.github/workflows/repo-visualizer.yml`](.github/workflows/repo-visualizer.yml) (githubocto/repo-visualizer / GitHub Next) regenerates `docs/assets/repo-visualization.svg` on every push to `main` and commits it back. Embedded in the README.
- 📈 **Star history graph** embedded via the api.star-history.com SVG endpoint.
- 📚 README slimmed down to a hub. Detailed deploy + updater content moved to [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md) and [`docs/UPDATER.md`](docs/UPDATER.md).
- ✨ Compact 4×5 features grid, deploy options as a one-line-per-mode table.

## [0.2.0] — Auto-updater, theme toggle, release workflow

### Added — Tauri Sparkle-style updater
- 🔄 **Auto-update for desktop builds** via `tauri-plugin-updater`. Polls `https://github.com/ArioMoniri/semikap/releases/latest/download/latest.json` on launch and every 6 h; signed bundles install with one click and relaunch.
- 🔑 **`scripts/init-updater.mjs`** generates the Ed25519 signing keypair via `tauri signer generate`, embeds the public key in `tauri.conf.json`, and prints the two GitHub secrets to add (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`).
- ✂️ **`scripts/release.mjs`** cuts a release: bumps `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to a new semver, commits, tags `v<version>`, pushes (with `--no-push` and `--any-branch` opt-outs).
- 🤖 `tauri-release.yml` extended to consume the signing secrets and emit `includeUpdaterJson: true`, producing the `latest.json` manifest the client polls.
- 🆙 `UpdatePrompt` extended: in the Tauri shell it shows update version + notes and an **Install update** button; in the browser PWA the original SW-update flow is unchanged.

### Added — Phase 5 polish
- 🌗 **Light / Dark / System theme** with `class`-strategy Tailwind dark mode. Persisted in localStorage; tracks `prefers-color-scheme` when set to System. Three-state toggle in the header.
- 🧪 **TTA manifest field** — `tta.flips: { x?, y?, z? }` parsed and validated in the manifest schema (inference plumbing for the average comes in 0.3).
- 🚦 **`preferredEP` manifest field** (`auto` | `webgpu` | `webnn` | `wasm`) — when set, the inference worker tries that EP first and falls back through the rest of the chain.

### Bumped
- `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → **0.2.0**

### Added — DICOM-SEG, Tauri desktop, one-line installer, UX redesign

Clinical export:
- 🩻 **DICOM-SEG export** via dcmjs. Available when the source image is a DICOM file; produces a Segmentation IOD that references the source's StudyInstanceUID / SeriesInstanceUID / FrameOfReferenceUID and ships per-segment metadata derived from the model manifest (label name, recommended display CIELab from the manifest colours).
- 🧰 Source-format detection (`dicom` / `nifti` / `nrrd` / `mha` / `mgz` / `other`) baked into the volume record. Export buttons gate on it.

Desktop:
- 🖥️ **Tauri v2 wrapper** scaffolded under `src-tauri/`. Same Vite-built frontend, native window, no browser chrome. Strict CSP carried through.
- 🤖 **Desktop release workflow** (`.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml`) builds macOS-arm64, macOS-x64, Linux-x64, Windows-x64 installers on every `v*` tag and publishes a draft GitHub Release.
- 📥 README **download buttons** for the latest release.

Install + ops:
- 🚀 `install.sh` — one-line clone + install + build + start. Curl-pipe-able. Re-runs are idempotent.
- ❤️ `/healthz` JSON endpoint in the static server (returns `{status: "ok", uptime}`); Docker HEALTHCHECK and Helm liveness/readiness probes now point at it.

Frontend:
- 🎨 **Kaapana-style sidebar** with collapsible sections (Inputs / Model / Inference / Display / Correction / Export / Settings) via Radix Collapsible.
- 🆕 Polished gradient header with inline `<Logo>`, GitHub link, EP + version badges; better empty-state copy in the viewer.
- 🌡️ **WW/WL presets**: CT abdomen / lung / bone / brain / mediastinum / liver, plus an "auto" reset.

Build:
- ⌛ `dcmjs` declared as an opaque module via `src/types/dcmjs.d.ts` — no bundle bloat from `@types/*` packages.
- typecheck / lint / build all clean.

### Added — Cursor probe + .env config template

- 🎯 **Cursor probe**: top-right floating panel shows the voxel index, the physical mm position, and the sampled value at the crosshair as you move it. Listens to NiiVue's location-change callback.
- 🧾 **`.env.example`** with `PORT` / `HOST` / `NODE_ENV`. Optional — every value still has a sensible default and the app boots without it. README documents it explicitly.

### Added — Performance + correction-export polish

- 📦 **Bundle slim-down**: WASM (the 25 MB ORT bundle) is no longer precached; it now downloads on demand on first inference. Cold install drops from ~28 MB to ~3 MB; if WebGPU services every run on the user's machine, WASM is never fetched at all.
- 💾 **Save corrected mask**: a third "Save corrected" button writes a NIfTI that combines the AI mask with the brush corrections. Eraser strokes propagate as 0; brush strokes override the AI label.
- ♿ **A11y**: skip-link to the viewer (visible on focus), `aria-label="Image viewer"` and `tabIndex={-1}` on the viewer section so the skip target receives focus.

### Added — Phase 2 / 3 / 4 polish

- 🩻 **Multi-series overlay**: SecondarySeriesPicker loads a second image as a coloured overlay (e.g. PET on CT, T2 on T1), with opacity + colormap controls. Safely resets when a new primary is loaded.
- ⛑️ **ErrorBoundary** wraps the app — synchronous render errors get a recoverable fallback, are logged to the OPFS audit, and never crash the page.
- 🔔 **Service-worker update prompt**: in-page toast when a new build is available; one-click "Reload" activates it. Also surfaces the "ready for offline use" toast on first install. Periodic update check (60 min cadence).
- ☸️ **Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/tamias`): Deployment + Service + optional Ingress + optional HPA. Non-root pod, read-only root FS, dropped capabilities. README and values.yaml call out the COOP/COEP-preservation requirement for the ingress controller.
- 📣 **README "no manual edits required" banner** at the top, plus a Configuration table covering every override (`PORT`, `HOST`, Helm image, ingress host, replicas, HPA).

### Added — Phase 2 / 3 increment

- 🌫️ **Gaussian-weighted sliding-window blending** — eliminates seams at tile boundaries (matches MONAI's default σ = patch/8)
- ⚡ **WebNN execution provider** added to the fallback chain (WebGPU → WebNN → WASM); UI surfaces both the resolved EP and the providers attempted
- 🗂️ **OPFS warm-cache wired into the model picker** — cached models list, one-click reload, hash-verify on retrieval, delete-from-cache
- 🎚️ **Display controls panel** — window centre / width sliders, mask opacity + colormap (red / green / blue / roi_i256)
- 🖌️ **Brush + eraser correction** via NiiVue's draw layer; per-label palette derived from the manifest, undo, auto-disable when no result
- 🧾 **Reproducibility bundle export** (JSON, schema `tamias.repro.v1`) — input file SHA-256, model SHA-256 + manifest, resolved provider chain, per-label volumes (mL), timing, app version
- 📒 **Local audit log in OPFS** — append-only NDJSON of every app-start, model-cache, inference, export, and error event; export + clear from a Settings panel
- 🩻 **Study metadata strip** floating over the viewer (file name, dims, spacing, dtype)
- 📐 **Volumetrics**: per-label voxel count + volume in mL, with a clearly-labelled voxel-perimeter surface-area approximation
- 🪪 App-version badge in the header (sourced from `package.json` via Vite `define`)

### Added — Phase 1 foundation

- 🐿️ **Project scaffold**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript (strict), Tailwind, ESLint flat config, Prettier
- 🛡️ **Privacy posture**: strict in-page CSP (no network egress), COOP/COEP enforcement (server + `coi-serviceworker` shim)
- 🌐 **PWA**: installable manifest, service-worker precache via `vite-plugin-pwa`, offline-first
- 📂 **Local file ingestion**: File System Access API on Chromium with drag-and-drop fallback
- 🖼️ **Viewer**: NiiVue wrapper supporting DICOM, NIfTI, NRRD, MetaImage, MGZ; multi-planar + 3D
- 🧠 **Inference**: `onnxruntime-web` with WebGPU EP and multi-threaded WASM-SIMD fallback, in a dedicated worker
- 🧱 **Sliding-window 3D inference** with per-tile accumulation and per-voxel argmax
- 📋 **Strict model manifest** schema + parser, optional SHA-256 verification
- 💽 **OPFS model cache** keyed by SHA-256
- 💾 **NIfTI-1 mask export** to local disk via FSA save dialog (with download fallback)
- 🔎 **GPU diagnostics**: surfaces vendor / architecture / device for the active WebGPU adapter, or WASM thread count
- 🎨 **shadcn-style UI**: Radix primitives + lucide-react icons + cva + tailwind-merge — Button, Card, Badge, Progress, Separator
- 🚀 **Static server** (`scripts/serve.mjs`): Node-only, sets COOP/COEP, picks default port `5180`, walks up if busy, prints `TAMIAS_PORT=<port>` to stdout for systemd / Docker / pm2
- 🐳 **Dockerfile + docker-compose** (multi-stage, non-root runtime user)
- 🤖 **GitHub Actions CI**: typecheck → lint → build → upload `dist/` artifact
